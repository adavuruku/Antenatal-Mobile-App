If you are trying to conceive during this menstrual cycle, keep a note of this highly significant date.\r\n\r\nAlthough this is officially the first day of your pregnancy, you won't conceive until around two weeks from now. This is classified as \"day one\" because once you conceive your pregnancy will be dated from the first day of your menstrual period. It would be more logical to date a pregnancy from the day of ovulation or conception, but, like most women, you're unlikely to know the day on which you ovulate, let alone conceive. You are, however, far more likely to remember when your last period started, especially if you're hoping to get pregnant and are keeping a record of your menstrual cycle. \r\n\r\nWhile dating a pregnancy in this way is a handy, if slightly baffling, convention, it does mean that your body is getting geared up for pregnancy from today. In around 280 days, or nine months' time, you could be holding your newborn baby in your arms. Good luck and enjoy the journey!."

       "tipsDescription":"By tracking your menstrual cycle and understanding how it works, you may increase your chances of conceiving.\r\n\r\nThis is day two of your period and day two of your complete menstrual cycle, which starts on the first day of your period and ends on the first day of your next period. A full cycle is, on average, 28 days, but many women have a shorter or longer cycle. \r\n\r\nThis may be the time when your period is at its heaviest, since the tissue and blood that make up the lining of the uterus (the endometrium) is shed. The average blood loss during menstruation is around two tablespoons (30 ml). While the lining is being sloughed off, the blood vessels in the uterus constrict, which can cause cramplike period pains. As soon as your period has finished, an egg begins to mature within its follicle in one of your ovaries, ready to be released around mid-cycle. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the lining of the uterus starts to build up again under the influence of the hormones progesterone and estrogen, ready to receive a fertilized egg. If the egg is not fertilized, hormone levels fall, the lining sheds, and the cycle begins again."

       "tipsDescription":"When you're trying to get pregnant, it helps to be aware of lifestyle and medical factors that can affect your menstrual cycle.\r\n\r\nYou may notice the timing and volume of your period differs. Your menstrual cycle can be affected by stress as well as by medical conditions, such as an overactive thyroid. In both these cases, periods can become lighter or less frequent. If your periods are erratic, it can be difficult to predict when you might ovulate. Unpredictable or missed periods may mean that ovulation isn't occurring at all. If you know this to be the case because you're monitoring the signs of ovulation , or using ovulation predictor tests, seek medical advice about your fertility. \r\n\r\nYou may be able to become pregnant naturally and easily despite problems related to your period, but some conditions that cause long, irregular, or heavy periods are linked to lower fertility. Heavy periods can be caused by conditions such as fibroids, which can affect fertility. A higher than average level of blood loss can also make you anemic, which is not the best start for pregnancy for you or your baby, so you may want to look at boosting your iron intake. \r\n\r\nPainful periods can impact fertility. Endometriosis is a common disorder that can make periods painful and cause discomfort during sex. If you have these symptoms, see your doctor who might arrange a scan or refer you to a specialist. In endometriosis, cells resembling those that line the uterus come to lie outside the uterus on structures such as the ovaries, the fallopian tubes, and walls of the pelvis. There are treatments for endometriosis, including laser surgery, that can boost a woman's chances of conceiving.\r\n"

       "tipsDescription":"Like many women, you may sometimes feel ruled by your hormones, and it helps to understand why they fluctuate.\r\n\r\nThe hormone build-up to ovulation starts right now in week one of your menstrual cycle. Your pituitary gland, which lies in the base of your brain, produces follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). During your period, the level of FSH rises steadily, triggering the development of the follicles (around 15-20 each month) in each ovary. As well as containing each egg, the follicles produce estrogen. \r\n\r\nThe hormone estrogen circulates, affecting the pituitary gland and causing it to produce luteinizing hormone (LH)-this triggers ovulation. This week your estrogen levels are low and steady, but will rise dramatically later in your cycle. \r\n\r\nProgesterone levels are low during your period, but start to rise several days afterward and stay high for the second part of the cycle. Under the influence of progesterone, the muscles in the cervix relax, easing open the cervical canal. Changes also affect the mucus, which becomes more fluid, so sperm find it easier to swim through. It is progesterone that enables the lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for implantation of the fertilized egg.\r\n"

One way is to cut down your alcohol intake. \r\n\r\nHeavy drinking can reduce the chances of conceiving and, if you do get pregnant, it can also harm your unborn baby's development. There is plenty of evidence that drinking beyond the recommended amounts is harmful. What's lacking is evidence of the effects on conception and pregnancy of the occasional alcoholic drink. There is no known safe level of alcohol consumption for pregnant women. However, many women decide to err on the side of caution and stop drinking alcohol entirely while trying to conceive and in early pregnancy. Some find that morning sickness naturally reduces desire for alcohol.\r\n\r\nAlcohol also affects male fertility. It has adverse effects on the quantity and quality of sperm produced, and drinking large amounts can cause impotence. \r\n\r\nYou may find a drink helps you and your partner relax and puts you in the mood for sex, thereby increasing your chances of conception, but you may want to rethink having the occasional glass of your favorite drink.

       "tipsDescription":"Eating well is an essential part of conception and pregnancy so you and your partner should get into good habits now.\r\n\r\nTake the time in this first two weeks of your cycle, before you ovulate, to look at what you eat on a daily basis-if you and your partner make some simple changes to your diet, it might just improve your chances of conception. \r\n\r\nUse this opportunity to check your weight ie. your Body Mass Index (BMI) since a BMI of under 19 or over 24 could adversely affect fertility. \r\n\r\nIf you're overweight, excess fat tissue may affect your metabolism and hormones and you may not ovulate as regularly, or at all. If you need fertility treatment, the chances of success are also lower if you're overweight, because you may respond less well to the drugs that stimulate ovulation. Once you're pregnant, being overweight can also cause an increased risk of complications, decreasing the chance of carrying the pregnancy to full term. \r\n\r\nWeighing too little when you're trying to conceive isn't healthy either. Pregnancy takes its toll on a woman's reserves, so a little stored fat is a good thing for mother and baby. Being seriously underweight can affect ovulation and make periods irregular or absent, and conception unlikely. \r\n\r\nYour BMI when you conceive is also a good indication of how much weight you should gain once you're pregnant, so it's worth getting it checked at this point."

       "tipsDescription":"When you're trying to get pregnant, you need to take your age into account because your fertility will change as you get older.\r\n\r\nIn about a week's time you are likely to ovulate. At the start of puberty, you had no more than about 400 eggs in your ovaries, and will have made no new eggs. Your lifetime of eggs were there when you were born. Given these facts, it's hardly a surprise that your fertility falls as you age. \r\n\r\nWomen 20-24 are generally at their most fertile and although, for most women, periods continue until their early fifties, the rate of fertility gradually lowers in the 30s, 40s, and 50s and the rate of chromosomal abnormalities and miscarriage increases. Nonetheless, every year thousands of babies are born to women in their late thirties and forties. Women can conceive beyond that age, which is why doctors advise menopausal women to use contraception for two years after their last period. \r\n\r\nIf, however, you're hoping to start a family, it's safe to assume that fertility begins to fall off sharply after age 35. Your age also affects the quality of your eggs. In women in their early 20s, around 17 percent of eggs have a chromosomal abnormality, but the figure rises to over 75 percent in women in their 40s. Chromosomal problems increase the chances of having a child with a disorder such as Down syndrome. \r\n\r\nIf you're concerned about your fertility, it is possible to have a blood test that can give an indication of your remaining ovary function so that you know how much reproductive time you have left. While some tests are based on levels of FSH and estrogen, newer tests use other markers found in the blood, such as anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) and inhibin B. \r\n\r\nBut making a baby depends on more than releasing an egg; it must travel down the fallopian tube, be fertilized, implant, and the pregnancy be maintained. There's also the father's contribution to consider.\r\n"

You will probably ovulate by the end of this week and will therefore be fertile. However, the fertile window can be from 5 days before ovulation to 12-24 hours after as sperm can survive for 5 days inside you. If your periods are regular, ovulation can be easier to track, but you may want to use other methods, such as looking out for natural signs or using an ovulation kit. Remember, however, the best way to conceive is to have sex regularly. \r\n\r\nWhile they are useful, testing kits are expensive and can be counterproductive because they make sex more clinical and less enjoyable. They work by testing the urine to detect a surge in LH, the hormone that triggers egg release. \r\n\r\nAlways follow the instructions given. Testing between 10 am and 8 pm should be fine, but try to aim for roughly the same time every day. After a positive test, you should ovulate 12-36 hours later. Results are about 99 percent accurate but occasionally the result is a false positive. Results can occasionally give a false negative, especially if you've drunk a lot of water.

While you were having your period, around 15-20 follicles were developing in your ovaries. \r\n\r\nBoth of your ovaries contribute to follicle growth, but usually only one ovary brings a follicle to ovulation. Which ovary it is seems to depend on chance since ovaries are not on a strict rotation. As the follicles grow, they enlarge greatly, filling with fluid secreted inside the follicle. Some women release more than one egg some months and if both are fertilized, it will mean nonidentical twins are conceived. \r\n\r\nBy the time of ovulation, the follicle will be about 1 in (2 cm) in diameter, while the egg is just about visible without a microscope. \r\n\r\nTo mature, follicles need FSH (follicle-stimulating hormone) produced by the brain's pituitary gland, but their early growth doesn't appear to rely on it.

Some experts claim there is a link between when you have sex and the baby's gender. \r\n\r\nRecent research suggests that women who have a high calorie intake (especially if they eat that most phallic of fruit, the banana) are marginally more likely to bear a boy. Those who skip breakfast or have a low calorie intake are more likely to have a girl.

This lack of success may be difficult to handle, especially if you're someone who has achieved in other areas of your life. \r\n\r\nWith reproduction, there's a large element of chance. Even for young women at their peak of fertility, the odds of conceiving in any one cycle are 50-50. It's not unusual to try for six months, or even 12 months, without success. Around 16 percent of couples take over a year to achieve a pregnancy. So plan for conception over a longer time frame, say 12 months, unless you have any specific reasons to be concerned about your fertility or your health in general. \r\n\r\nThe main exception is if you are over 30. In this case, see your doctor after trying for about six months. The first step is likely to be a blood test for you, and a semen analysis for your partner. However, be reassured that if you are over 30, you may still get pregnant in the old-fashioned way. The average time taken for a 39-year-old woman to conceive is 15 months.

The rise in estrogen from the follicles is what stimulates the release of the LH hormone, which surges about 24 hours before ovulation. FSH from the pituitary gland starts rising later this week. Progesterone levels are low. There's no call for this hormone until the uterus lining needs to thicken. In fact, high levels would make the cervix hostile to sperm, so they would have trouble getting through to the uterus and the fallopian tubes to fertilize the egg. \r\n\r\nWomen also produce the male hormone testosterone and this reaches a peak around ovulation.

With all the recommendations and restrictions, not to mention old wives' tales, that supposedly maximize conception rates, it's easy to forget that sex is meant to be enjoyable. If you're hell bent on conceiving, then the fun can get forgotten. You might want to try different positions, times, or places for sex. If you and your partner aren't usually that adventurous, this is a good opportunity to try varying things a little. \r\n\r\nTry to have sex every 24-48 hours. If your partner ejaculates regularly, it will encourage the production of quality sperm. The benefits of abstaining have been greatly overstated in the past. It is true that not having sex for up to seven days can boost the number of sperm, but research now shows that abstinence can impair the motility (swimming ability) of sperm, especially if the sperm were already borderline.

Ovulation is when an egg is released from your ovaries (sometimes two eggs are released). LH rises thanks to estrogen output from the growing follicles, and it is this rise that triggers the events that now take place in the follicle. LH makes the egg inside the follicle become fully mature, ready for release and fertilization. This is the point at which the egg reduces its number of chromosomes from 46 to 23. \r\n\r\nThe follicle is rich with fluid by now. Just before ovulation, it is some 1 in (2 cm) or more in diameter. In position, it lies just below the surface of the ovary. If you could see the follicle, it would look like a blister about to burst. Next the follicle produces enzymes that digest its outer layer, releasing the egg on to the surface of the ovary.\r\n\r\nOnce the egg is released from the follicle, it's soon swept into the nearest fallopian tube by the fingerlike projections that form the end of the tube, where it will hopefully be fertilized.\r\n"

Once it has been released by the ovary, the egg is swept up by one of your fallopian tubes and, moving in the direction of the uterus, comes to rest in the widest portion of the tube, awaiting fertilization. \r\n\r\nIt is no exaggeration to say that for each sperm released the chance of even reaching the site of fertilization is in the order of one in a million. Around 300 sperm reach the tube but only one will fertilize the egg. Once the sperm has penetrated, it triggers a reaction that makes the surface impenetrable. Each sperm and egg contain 23 chromosomes, half of the total genetic material required. The egg will always contain an X chromosome but the sperm will carry either an X or Y chromosome and therefore determines the sex of the embryo.

It does this by producing a new hormone, called human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG). This hormone overrides your usual monthly cycle and maintains the high progesterone levels that are essential for your pregnancy. The hormone progesterone is essential to an embryo's survival in the uterus, and therefore to your baby's well-being and development before birth. \r\n\r\nLater, starting around weeks four to five, your embryo will make all the hormones needed to maintain its own life.

Try confiding in a good friend about your problems so that you have someone to talk to, but try not to become obsessive and let it dominate all your relationships. \r\n\r\nIf you've only just started trying, remember there is a only a one in four or five chance that you will conceive each month, so you're unlikely to get pregnant in the first month of trying!\r\n"

You'll find yourself analyzing every twinge in your body as you look for signs that you're pregnant.\r\n\r\nIt's still very early and you're unlikely to have pregnancy symptoms yet-although you may have some light spotting. Some women claim to \"feel\" pregnant, even before changes to their breasts are noticeable or before they start feeling sick. Some women say that they just \"know.\" You may be very in tune with your body and may notice that your body is changing even before you are able to take a test. Unfortunately, sometimes our minds can play tricks on us: you may want to be pregnant so much that you can sometimes convince yourself that you're feeling different. If you don't feel any different, don't worry, this is also completely normal. \r\n\r\nEither way the only definitive way to know whether or not you are pregnant is to take a pregnancy test. You don't need to go to your doctor to confirm your pregnancy since the tests that they use are the same as those bought over the counter. If the test is positive, you're pregnant!\r\n"

In most cases it is pinkish, although bright red blood (fresh blood) can occur, as can brownish, old blood. As long as it is not profuse, the color really doesn't matter. If the bleeding lasts for a short period, and you don't experience discomfort, it's likely that things are just fine, but do see your doctor for a checkup. \r\n\r\nAround 25 percent of women will experience some bleeding in early pregnancy, but most go on to full term.

You might feel low if you have your usual PMS symptoms and think it means that you haven't conceived, but in fact, there are many similarities between the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and those of early pregnancy. This is because the hormones that cause PMS are raised in pregnancy and so can cause the same symptoms. In addition to this, you might be irritable and emotional even without having PMS, just due to the anxiety of wanting to be pregnant and waiting to see whether or not your period arrives. \r\n\r\nWhile you are in the middle of this storm of hormones and raging emotions it can be difficult to remain calm. Talk to your partner about your emotions and anxieties-just expressing that you're finding things stressful can help you get through this tense time. Alternatively, confide in a female relative or friend, who might be able to relate to how you're feeling. \r\n\r\nFrustratingly, at this point it is still a waiting game; all you can do is try to be patient until you take your pregnancy test.

This is produced by an implanting embryo and will be found in your urine if you are pregnant. Levels of hCG are likely to be over 50 mIU\/ml on the day your period is due. With between 97 and 99 percent accuracy, the majority of over-the-counter tests are sensitive enough to detect this amount, so they can be used on the first day of your missed period; some can be used earlier. \r\n\r\nThe tests only turn positive once there is a certain level of the hCG hormone present in your urine: if you test too early, the result might be negative even though you are pregnant. Therefore, if you don't get your period but you had a negative result, test again after two to three days. If you are pregnant, the levels of hCG will have risen, giving a positive result. \r\n\r\nIf you get a positive result but your period starts anyway, it may be that you have suffered a very early miscarriage."

The group of cells, that will become your baby is currently shaped as a flat disk and undergoing significant development. A narrow groove begins to form down the middle of the cells. The leading edge of the groove is slightly wider forming a circular \"node.\" The outer edges of the node and groove are slightly raised. The cells move from the rolled edges of these structures downward into the groove to lie between the original two layers of cells. This creates three layers of cells, those on each outer disk surface and those sandwiched between them. The node and groove do not extend along the entire length of the disk. \r\n\r\nAt the head end, a separate groove forms. Called the neural groove, this ultimately forms the brain and spinal cord (the central nervous system). In four days time, the disk will lengthen and widen at the end that will form your baby's head.

So in the past, pregnant women were likely to continue eating unhealthy foods, drinking alcohol, and smoking. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, pregnancy tests tended to be much less accurate or sensitive, meaning that many pregnancies ended in early miscarriage without anyone being aware.

This part of the brain consists of the thalamus-involved with emotions and sensory perception-and the two cerebral hemispheres, both quite smooth at this point. Each hemisphere contains a fluid-filled chamber and within that the cerebrospinal fluid is produced. \r\n\r\nAt the 11-14 week scan, brain development checkups will be done to confirm that the baby has normal early cerebral development."

Low down, near the jaw line, the ears form, each arising from six small mounds, fusing together to give your baby his unique and individual ear shape. As the face and jaw forms and your baby's neck extends moving away from the chest wall, the ears migrate upward; they will come to lie at the same level as his eyes by 11 weeks. \r\n\r\nThe lips and nose are now beginning to take shape. To form the upper lip, two separate ridges of tissue grow from each side of your baby's face to fuse with the small piece of tissue in the midline extending downward beneath the nose (the grooved part of the upper lip). \r\n\r\nAt around this stage, your baby's small and large bowel lengthen. Because they have insufficient room to expand inside the still very curled-up embryo, the intestines appear as a bulge on the surface of the abdominal wall. This bulge is covered by a membrane, into which the umbilical cord becomes attached. The bowel will continue to grow in this embryonic sac until 11-12 weeks when it will be reabsorbed into the abdominal cavity, leaving just the surface attachment of the cord."

Valves within the heart ensure that the blood only travels one way and all of the major blood vessels are now established. Your baby's eyes appear open because the eyelids have just started to appear and have yet to fuse. In reality, they won't properly open until week 26.

Hearing requires the middle and inner ear to structurally mature and the inner ear to complete nerve connections to the brain. Hearing will, however, be one of the first senses to develop and can be tested by seeing if the baby responds to the sound waves that reach him in the uterus. Judging when taste is established is harder, but taste buds have started to appear on the tongue. \r\n\r\nYour baby's eyes have a lens and early retina but even if the eyelids were open the eyes would not yet be able to see light signals. The lens is solid and the optic nerve is not yet responding to signals from the retina. \r\n\r\nMore signs of bodily movement appear but although your baby is quite active he is too light for you to feel the kicks.

You'll have your first ultrasound around now and see your baby; this may help you feel closer to her. For many men, seeing the baby on the scan may be the first time the pregnancy becomes a reality. \r\n\r\nAt this scan, your baby's length will be measured and this will be used to figure out her age. Up until about 12 weeks of pregnancy, all babies grow at around the same rate so irrespective of whether you and your partner are tall or short, at this time your baby will be the same size as others at this stage of development. \r\n\r\nFiguring out your due date using the first day of your period, isn't always accurate, especially if your menstrual cycle is long or irregular. The dating scan can give a more accurate expected date of delivery, but it by no means tells you for certain-very few babies arrive on their actual due date."

This is known as the CRL (crown-rump length). \r\n\r\nSince your baby can flex his spine and stretch his neck, this measurement needs to be taken with your baby in a specific position so it can take some time to achieve. The measurement is used to estimate your baby's date of delivery and this may be different than the EDD you calculated. \r\n\r\nThis first ultrasound scan should be able to recognize all four limbs, your baby's hands and feet, the spine, some aspects of brain development, the fluid-filled stomach, and the bladder. From now on your baby's kidneys will be producing small amounts of very dilute urine and the bladder will start to fill."

The heart and its internal electrical conducting system are structurally complete but its external nerve supply is still quite immature. The nerves to the heart influence its rhythm, gradually slowing the rate as the pregnancy advances. \r\n\r\nThe heart is tiny and to maintain an adequate output the heart is unable to increase the amount of blood it pumps with each beat (as we can), but instead increases the number of times it beats each minute. \r\n\r\nThe abdominal cavity is large enough to hold the intestines. Whereas before they were bulging outside of your baby's body, they now fit into her abdominal cavity. Having started to rotate while outside the body, the bowel completes its final rotation in the abdominal cavity. Once inside, the bowel position remains fixed, and its diameter increases as the loops of bowel become hollow."

This is because your heart and lungs are having to work much harder to supply your body with oxygen due to all the changes that are taking place to allow the baby to grow. \r\n\r\nThe amount of oxygen you need in pregnancy is about 20 percent more than normal; some of this goes to the placenta and baby and the rest to your other organs. To get this increased amount of oxygen you breathe faster and deeper, almost hyperventilating so you feel short of breath, especially when you exercise. \r\n\r\nAs your pregnancy continues, you may find that this shortness of breath or feeling that you are not breathing very deeply continues, or worsens. As the baby grows, your uterus will expand upward and your other abdominal organs will rearrange themselves to create more room. Your organs and uterus push up against your diaphragm so it becomes more difficult to take a deep breath, so in order to get all the oxygen you need, you then have to breathe much faster. The hormone progesterone may also affect the rate at which you breathe. \r\n\r\nIf you have any concerns about breathlessness, don't hesitate to speak to your doctor."

Swallowing develops earlier than sucking. Your baby will be swallowing the amniotic fluid regularly but the more complex sucking movements cannot be identified until 18-20 weeks. Swallowing will encourage gut development. The amniotic fluid enters into the stomach not the lungs, which are protected now by the vocal cords and the higher pressure of the lung's own fluid. The amniotic fluid will later be excreted as urine when the fetal kidneys start to function. \r\n\r\nAfter the stomach, the amniotic fluid will enter the small bowel. The intestinal walls are developing muscular layers but these do not yet contract in a coordinated way to move the fluid along the digestive tract. It will be 20 weeks before the structural organization of the gut is finally complete. Many digestive enzymes are starting to be released into the gut but these currently act as a stimulus to development rather than for the absorption of nutrients. \r\n\r\nYour baby is reliant on a steady stream of glucose, which is stored as glycogen in the liver. This continues throughout pregnancy and at birth your baby will, for her size, have significantly larger glycogen reserves than adults do. The correct level of glucose is controlled by insulin secreted by the pancreas. The placenta, however, has little control over the amount it takes from your blood-stream and passes on. For this reason if your glucose level is very high, for example in poorly controlled diabetes, the baby will be presented with high levels of glucose. He will maintain a normal glucose level but the insulin released leads to increased fat deposition and weight gain."

Compare this with your own production of 2-3 percent body weight as urine. \r\n\r\nYour temperature directly influences your baby's temperature.

The placenta has been able to form clots for some time, reducing the risk of bleeding. A small number of white blood cells are now being produced by your baby but she is still relying on yours to fight infection. Her red blood cells contain hemoglobin that transfers oxygen to all the cells of the body. Before birth she has several forms of hemoglobin that differ from yours.

It's common for pregnant women to snore. This is largely due to increased swelling of the nasal passages, but it can also be caused by increased weight and the fact that you may roll over onto your back during the night. \r\n\r\nYour stuffy nose is due to the increased volume of blood in your body while you're pregnant. This can cause congestion and make your ears feel blocked, too. Nosebleeds are also very common in pregnancy; some women find that every time they blow their nose they have a small amount of bleeding. This is because the blood vessels in the nose are very fragile, and with the increased volume of blood flowing through them, they tend to bleed more easily. However, the bleeding should be very light. \r\n\r\nTo treat a nosebleed, tip your head forward and pinch the middle of your nose (in the soft part) hard. It should stop quickly.

The outer layer of cells in the placenta move into the coiled, or spiral, arteries in the uterus, destroying their muscular wall. This causes the arteries to dilate, resulting in a low resistance to blood flow. Only those arteries beneath the placenta (80-100 vessels) are invaded by the placental cells in this way. If these cells move too deeply, they can fuse too tightly with the muscle of the uterus and have difficulty separating after delivery. If the wave of invading cells is inadequate, however, the low resistance to blood flow doesn't develop. This can increase the risk of the mother developing preeclampsia, and cause the baby growth problems."

The ideal image is a woman with thick shiny hair and perfect skin that has a healthy blush. \r\n\r\nThe improved condition of your skin is thanks to the hormone estrogen (pregnancy hormones can have positive effects, too!) and the increased blood supply to the skin; the many blood vessels just below the skin's surface give you a healthy glow, or at least stop you from looking pale and tired. The glands also secrete more oil, giving your skin a healthy-looking sheen. \r\n\r\nAgain due to hormonal changes, your hair may look thicker. Less hair than normal falls out during pregnancy and hair grows more quickly. After the birth you may find that your hair appears to be falling out more than normal as you lose the hair that's built up during the nine months. Normal hair loss is about 100-125 hairs a day; after the birth you might lose 500 hairs a day. \r\n\r\nIf you don't feel you match this picture of good health, it may just be that you can't see it yourself, especially if you're still adapting to your pregnancy.

       "tipsDescription":"The neural tube, the basis of your baby's spinal cord, developed in the very early weeks; now the spinal cord is fully formed.\r\n\r\nNerves from your baby's spinal cord are linked to each set of vertebrae, but as your baby lengthens the spinal cord does not grow at the same rate, and the lower tip ends up lying at the mid-lumbar level, half way between the hips and lowest rib. \r\n\r\nBelow the mid-lumbar level, the nerves leaving the spinal cord have lengthened so that they still exit between the lowest vertebrae. In adult life, the cord will end slightly higher than in the newborn baby. Because the spinal cord does not extend the entire length of the vertebral canal, a fluid-filled space fills the lower portion. \r\n\r\nBy the end of this week, your baby is able to use fat as a source of energy. This isn't, however, an important source of energy because that need is met largely by glucose crossing the placenta from your bloodstream. Free fatty acids in your circulation easily cross the placenta to your baby and are used for organ growth, forming cell walls, making myelin sheaths around nerves to insulate them, and for many other functions. \r\n\r\nCholesterol is not only supplied to your unborn baby via the placenta, but he is also forming it within his own body. For this reason, your cholesterol level bears little relation to your baby's, which needs to be high for your baby to produce fat, especially in the first few months of pregnancy."

This is because the weight of your uterus will press on the major veins that return blood to your heart, which may result in dizziness, low blood pressure, and possibly a reduction in blood flow to the uterus. Ideally, lie on your left side (although it will do you or your baby no harm to lie on your right side) since this is actually good for you and the baby. It improves blood flow to the placenta and helps your kidneys eliminate fluids and waste products. Don't worry if you wake to find you're lying on your back: just roll onto your side and support yourself with pillows if necessary. \r\n\r\nIt's fine to lie on your front if you prefer (your baby is safely cushioned in the amniotic fluid), but the bigger you get, the more difficult this will become."

In the next few weeks, you may begin to feel some slight fluttering movements, particularly if this is not your first pregnancy. You'll only be aware of those movements that cause your baby to make contact with the inner muscular wall of your uterus. \r\n\r\nThe placenta itself can act like a cushion absorbing the impact of all but the strongest of the baby's movements. For this reason, women with an anterior placenta (one lying on the front wall of the uterus-that closest to the skin) often feel the movements at a much later stage than those with a posteriorly sited placenta (one that lies closer to the back). \r\n\r\nYour baby's brain is continuing to develop. The nerve cells that will form the outer gray matter start centrally within the brain, and need to move outward to their final position. This process takes place in waves that occur from 8 to 16 weeks. The migration process is not complete until 25 weeks and electrical activity cannot be detected until 29 weeks. Even after this point, gray matter continues to mature and organize neural connections in the brain throughout the pregnancy. Your baby's body is now longer than her head for the first time."

The most superficial layer of epidermal cells flatten but do not harden until much later. \r\n\r\nThe dermis is made from connective tissue comprising collagen (90 percent) and elastin fibers that allow for stretch and resistance. Within the dermis are blood vessels and nerves that support the epidermis and provide sensory feedback. At first, the junction between the dermis and epidermis is smooth, but increasingly dermal ridges form and it becomes irregular. \r\n\r\nAt the same time your baby starts to develop hair follicles. There is no significant subcutaneous fat present at this stage and the skin is almost transparent. Fat plays a part in temperature control and acts as a barrier to the passage of water.

The cells lining the airways constantly produce fluid that leaves the lungs when your baby makes breathing movements. The release of this fluid is regulated by the vocal cords within the larynx. \r\n\r\nIn addition to fluid, the lungs have glands that produce mucus. Cells with tiny hairlike structures, known as cilia, have appeared that help move the mucus. This production of mucus is important once the baby is born to prevent the constant flow of air from drying the lining of the lungs, to trap dust particles, and to act as a barrier to infection. \r\n\r\nBecause the gut is still very immature, the gradual increase in amniotic fluid is due to the relatively low frequency of fetal swallowing. By 37 weeks your baby will be swallowing 1.75 pints (almost a liter), half of the total amniotic fluid volume, each day."

Because ultrasound waves do not travel well in air, gel is applied to the end of the probe or \"transducer\" as it is placed on your abdomen. This then detects the heartbeat and converts it into a sound that we can hear. \r\n\r\nIt's quite easy to distinguish your baby's heartbeat from your own since it beats almost twice as fast. However, your baby's heart rate peaked around five weeks ago and, since then, has slowed down as the nerves controlling the heart's rhythm have matured. \r\n\r\nDuring the second half of pregnancy, the range of the heartbeat is between 120 and 160 beats per minute and will be responsive to many stimuli, as well as to your baby's activity."

       "tipsDescription":"Ensuring you drink enough fluids is essential to good health in pregnancy, so carry your bottle of water everywhere.\r\n\r\nStaying hydrated in pregnancy can be a challenge. Because of the hormonal changes taking place, some of the fluid you take in leaks into your body tissues, rather than staying within the bloodstream. \r\n\r\nIt's difficult to recommend an exact amount of fluid that should be drunk to keep you hydrated, since this depends on many factors, such as the foods you eat (some naturally contain water), your size, the amount you exercise, and the heat and humidity in the environment. Therefore, you need to listen to your own body to determine if you're adequately hydrated. One of the best ways to do this is to look at your urine. If it's clear to light yellow, you're adequately hydrated. If it's bright yellow or orange, you're likely to be dehydrated. \r\n\r\nDrinking plenty of water is important. Sometimes, though, if you are nauseous, or just plain tired of drinking water, you may want to try other options for hydration, such as drinking juice or eating more fruit. Remember that caffeinated beverages, such as coffee, are not hydrating; caffeine has a diuretic effect, which means that you will want to urinate more often. \r\n\r\nIn the second and third trimester, dehydration in pregnancy can lead to premature contractions. This is because an anti-diuretic hormone is produced to help your body hold on to water. This hormone acts a lot like oxytocin, the hormone that triggers labor, causing contractions. Staying hydrated will prevent this from happening."

When he breathes in, the diaphragm moves downward and the chest wall moves inward. \r\n\r\nEach \"breath\" the baby takes lasts less than a second. Breathing might only happen occasionally at this stage and when it does it can be either regular or irregular. \r\n\r\nYour baby might also open his jaw and swallow at the same time as making a breathing movement. A single breathing movement with a large movement of the diaphragm may resemble a sigh. \r\n\r\nFor the chest wall movements to be effective, there must be adequate amniotic fluid. This is especially true for the critical time of lung development, from 16-26 weeks. \r\n\r\nBy the 24th week of pregnancy, your baby will spend approximately three hours in a 24-hour period practicing breathing movements, and around eight hours in a 24-hour period in the last eight weeks of pregnancy."

Nutrients supplied across the placenta provide your baby with energy for growth, but growth is in part regulated by her own insulin production and insulin-like growth factors.

Also remember that while you're awake, your baby spends a lot of time sleeping. \r\n\r\nThere are a few ways you can try to stimulate your baby into action-the more he moves, the more chance there is that you'll feel it. First of all, stop and relax. If you've been busy all day, you may have been distracted and not felt your baby's movements. Keeping still may also waken him, since he isn't being \"rocked\" within your uterus. \r\n\r\nTry playing loud music to him, which will not only wake him, but also encourage him to respond. Some women report that their unborn babies \"kicked\" to a rhythm! \r\n\r\nIt may also help to lie down on your side, with your belly supported. Doing this may stimulate your baby to move, as he changes his position to accommodate yours. If all else fails, have a sweet, icy cold drink, which may do the trick."

The ridge patterns in the dermis that will eventually form fingerprints (and \"toeprints\") are fully developed by this stage of pregnancy. These skin ridges are genetically determined and, as with most developments, are seen about a week earlier in the hands than the feet. \r\n\r\nYour baby's sweat glands appeared in his skin in the eighth week, and will continue to increase up to 28 weeks; but they do not function until after birth. The color of your baby's skin is due to melanin, a pigment produced by \"melanocytes,\" specialized skin cells that have now migrated into the skin. Different skin tones are not due to differing numbers of these cells but due to the amount and shade of pigment that each cell produces. Melanin protects the skin from ultraviolet light which damages DNA.\r\n\r\nAlthough unborn babies produce melanin pigment, they do not achieve their final amount of skin pigment until well into childhood. For this reason it follows that all newborn babies are particularly vulnerable to sunburn. Dark-skinned babies are likely to have a light skin tone when they're born."

For most women and their partners, this scan will reassure them that all is progressing well with the baby's development. \r\n\r\nThe scan can take some time to perform because of the detailed measurements and investigations taking place. The sonographer can only do the checks when the baby is in the correct position-this can be a challenge, given that the baby is likely to be moving around a lot. If the position of your baby makes it difficult to do all the checks, you may be asked to walk around for a little while and then return, or even to come back in a week or two for another attempt."

While your baby has been moving in your uterus since around the sixth week of gestation, it's only at this stage that she'll make her movements so definitely felt (although some women do feel movements from around 15 to 16 weeks). When exactly you feel that movement can be affected by your body weight, your baby's position, the location of your placenta, and whether it's your first pregnancy. \r\n\r\nExperiencing the first sensation of movement, whether it's a feeling of bubbles, butterflies, flipping goldfish, or even a resounding kick, is likely to be an emotionally charged moment.

It's thought that because memory starts developing around now, twin babies may begin to bond at this stage. \r\n\r\nAs ultrasound scanning has proven, there's plenty of contact between twin babies in the uterus, especially as the amount of space decreases. They have been seen to touch often, kick, and try to grab. Each twin reacts to the other's movements. \r\n\r\nThey may not act in the same way, with one twin favoring different movements than the other one. For instance, one baby may prefer sucking his thumb, while the other likes clutching his cord. Nor do they necessarily have the same body clock, so they may be active at different times.

Sound is thought to be the first sense to develop, although taste buds are at least present on the tongue from as early as 10 weeks. Nerves carrying the sensations of pain, temperature, and light touch from your baby's body reach his spinal cord and then travel to the hypothalamus, which lies in the center of the brain. This then sends signals to another part of your baby's brain so that the stimuli can be recognized and also evoke an emotional response. Many, but not all, of these nerves require insulation around them to conduct signals effectively. Known as myelin sheaths, these do not develop until much later, after 29 weeks in the spine and 37 weeks in the brain. \r\n\r\nPainful stimuli result in a reflex action (such as pulling your hand away from a hot object). Reflexes don't have to involve the brain and for these sensations to be recognized at a conscious level, rather than as a simple reflex, the nerves need to connect the hypothalamus to the gray matter in the brain. These connections are thought to function after 26 weeks of pregnancy, but it may be 34 weeks before their electrical activity can be clearly seen on an electroencephalogram (EEG)."

Women who are carrying twins or triplets do, of course, show earlier and have much larger bellies than those expecting one baby. \r\n\r\nThe size of your belly is, however, a good indicator of your baby's growth, so it will be measured by your doctor (see Measuring your baby). She will measure from a point on your pubic bone in your pelvis to the top, or fundus, of the uterus. This measurement should correlate with the number of weeks you're pregnant, with an accuracy of within 3\/4 in (2 cm). So, if you're 28 weeks pregnant your belly should measure 10 1\/4-11 3\/4 in (26-30 cm).

So, when you're feeling stressed, make adequate time to relax and take care of yourself, for your baby's sake."

       "tipsDescription":"Now that your baby's ears are sufficiently well developed to process sounds, his hearing will gradually improve.\r\n\r\nYour baby's external ears have been developed for some time but for him to hear, the internal ear structures also need to mature. In the middle ear, three bones-the malleus (\"hammer\"), incus (\"anvil\"), and stapes (\"stirrup\")-conduct sound into the inner ear. These bones are formed initially from soft cartilage and embedded within connective tissue. The bones begin to harden and the connective tissue gradually dissolves. This allows the ear drum to vibrate onto the hammer, which passes the movement on to the anvil, and then the stirrup. The vibrations are then passed to the cochlea, a cavity of the inner ear, where they are translated into nerve impulses to be sent to the brain. \r\n\r\nAt 22 weeks, your baby's inner ear has matured adequately for sound to be processed into neural signals to the brain. The first part of the cochlea to develop is responsible for receiving lower-sound frequencies. As your baby develops, he will gradually be able to recognize and respond to higher sound frequencies. Over the next three weeks, your baby's responsiveness to sounds will gradually increase. At first the responses are slow and sluggish, but by 25 weeks he will react to a range of sounds by moving around. \r\n\r\nIn addition to being responsible for your baby's hearing, the inner ear also controls his balance. Small fibers within three semicircular canals of the inner ear are able to sense acceleration in any direction, providing the sense of motion and balance. Floating in the amniotic fluid is similar to weightlessness and, although your baby is very active, he has no sense yet of moving up and down."

It's normal to be drawn to other women who are pregnant or who have recently had a baby, and common to make friends at prenatal classes. It's natural to want to surround yourself with people who are going through or who have been through the same experience as you, not least because you will have so many questions they can answer. You might also feel closer to female relatives, especially your mother. \r\n\r\nYou may find that friends who are not pregnant or who don't have children may not be as interested in all the details of your pregnancy. It may be difficult for them to comprehend how all-encompassing pregnancy and then having a child is; it may be literally all you can think about. If these are friendships you value, make an effort to have some \"nonpregnancy\" chats. It will be good for you not to be 100 percent focused on the pregnancy.\r\n\r\nIf you find you drift apart from these friends for a while, don't worry.

How this process develops is not fully understood, but experts believe that the first signs of learning coincide with the unborn baby's ability to hear, at around this mid-stage of pregnancy. \r\n\r\nIn later months, more sound will reach your baby as the walls of the uterus become thinner. Although babies have been seen to be startled by a noise at this stage, they seem to learn not to react to the sound if it is repeated again and again, gradually adapting to it as it's repeated over time, and eventually ignoring it. \r\n\r\nThis simple test demonstrates that a fetus can adapt to a repeated stimulus. If, however, the sound pattern is not repeated for some time, your baby will have forgotten it and become startled by it if it occurs again. \r\n\r\nRetaining a memory for events is a much more complex function and relies on pathways in the gray matter of the brain. It will be weeks before learning and memory are linked in the last stages of your pregnancy."

It's common to feel dizzy when you stand up suddenly; this is because, although your blood supply has increased during pregnancy, getting up quickly causes the blood to rush into your legs. This reduces the supply of blood to your brain, making you feel light-headed. \r\n\r\nDizziness can also be a symptom of anemia. Although you produce more red blood cells in pregnancy than before, your volume of blood also increases. This means that proportionally there are fewer red blood cells and your blood count will drop. You may also become short of iron and, if this is the case, you will be prescribed iron supplements. In addition to dizziness, symptoms of anemia include fatigue and shortness of breath. Low blood-sugar levels can also cause dizziness and can be prevented by eating snacks regularly. \r\n\r\nIf you're feeling dizzy, although it's likely to be due to the physiological changes in pregnancy, inform your doctor so you can be examined and any relevant blood tests taken. If you feel dizzy when you're out and about, or if you need a seat on a bus or train, always tell someone-the majority of people will be understanding."

There are, however, also emotional reasons: if you're preoccupied by being pregnant, your concentration is bound to slip now and then, making you less likely to notice potential hazards in your path. \r\n\r\nThe good news is that your usual grace will return once you're no longer pregnant, but until that time it's important to avoid situations that might put you at risk of injury. So wear flat shoes rather than heels, avoid wet or slippery surfaces, and be careful on steep staircases. Tape down the edges of loose rugs, and keep the stairs and hallways clear of things that might trip you up. Be particularly careful when you're lifting something because it's very easy to lose your balance if you're leaning forward. Be careful also, getting into and out of the bath or shower, since these are notorious hotspots for pregnancy-related injuries. \r\n\r\nIt's worth noting that normal clumsiness in pregnancy is not accompanied by visual disturbances, headaches, or dizziness, so if you have any of these symptoms, you should see your doctor."

Hair and nails also form from keratin. \r\n\r\nThe outer keratinized layer of skin cells, plus a layer of fat laid down between the skin cells, gives the skin a waterproof covering. This process of keratinization reduces the amount of water your baby loses into the amniotic fluid. Each new skin cell, made in the deepest part of the skin, matures as it gradually moves up toward the surface and, now keratinized, becomes part of the outer protective layer before it is eventually shed. The cycle takes approximately 30 days. \r\n\r\nThe thickest layers of keratinized cells are on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet. The keratinizing process has only just begun. Since the fat layer is very thin at this stage, your baby's skin will still appear translucent, but less so than it did in earlier weeks. At this stage of pregnancy, your baby still has plenty of room to maneuver inside the uterus, and although you're likely to be feeling lots of movements by now this will only be a fraction of the total. This is because the only movements you'll feel are those that cause your baby to kick or bump into the wall of your uterus.

Your baby is now covered in extremely fine and short hairs, known as \"lanugo.\" This layer of hair will be almost completely lost before birth. The hairs help trap vernix onto the surface of the skin; this is the white, greasy layer that you often see in patches on a baby's skin at birth. It collects in the skin folds and creases and helps protect the baby's skin not only from the water content of the amniotic fluid, but also the waste products within it. \r\n\r\nAs your pregnancy advances, your baby's kidney function is improving and the amniotic fluid produced becomes increasingly similar to urine in its composition."

This substance enables the smallest air sacs to remain open when the newborn baby breathes in and out so that gas transfer can continually take place. Without it, the tiny air sacs would collapse after each breath and it would take much more effort to move air in and out of the lungs.

The precise function of yawning for the baby remains in doubt and there are several hypotheses. While it's difficult to imagine that an unborn baby is actually tired, it has been found that babies who are anemic yawn much more frequently than others. Another theory is that yawning may help the unborn baby to regulate the amount of fluid or blood flow he has within his lungs. Or yawning may simply be a primitive reflex, a remnant from an earlier evolutionary stage, with no current function. Whatever the reason for yawning, the early stage at which this develops in the unborn baby, and the fact that all mammals are known to yawn in the uterus, does suggest that it plays an important, though unknown, role in fetal development."

Because your body temperature is so closely controlled, your baby never becomes cold so never needs to shiver. He has started to lay down a special form of brown fat, particularly around the neck, chest, and back. After birth, metabolism of this fat produces both energy and heat. In the uterus, however, the baby cannot use this fat to raise his temperature. Some temperature control occurs as heat is lost from the baby's skin into the amniotic fluid through the uterine wall and then into your body tissues. However, the regulation of temperature is predominantly achieved by means of the blood flow to the placenta. The large surface area of the placenta allows it to act as a heat exchange, keeping the temperature of the blood leaving the baby in the umbilical arteries constant with that of the oxygenated blood returning to the baby through the umbilical vein. \r\n\r\nAfter birth, babies lose heat quickly.

The adrenal glands are roughly triangular in shape, with their base wrapped over the top of each kidney. They have an outer layer, or cortex, which releases steroid hormones such as cortisol, and an inner layer, or medulla. Adrenaline and the related hormone noradrenaline are secreted from the medulla in response to stress. \r\n\r\nAdrenaline prepares the body for a \"fight or flight\" response, increasing the availability of glucose, speeding up the heart rate, and maintaining or raising blood pressure. These are vital adaptive responses for your baby that will help to maintain a stable environment within the uterus and prepare her for the stresses of life later on in the outside world. \r\n\r\nIt is the outer cortex, however, that needs to work hard, producing many hormones that help to coordinate your baby's growth and development. The cortex produces three types of hormones: mineralocorticoids that regulate salt balance; glucocorticoids that help to control the availability of sugars, fat, and amino acids in the bloodstream; and androgens, male-type sex hormones, such as testosterone. It is the cortex that accounts for the large size of your baby's adrenal glands. After birth, in the first couple of weeks, the adrenal glands rapidly reduce in size."

Coming to rest close to the brain's surface, these cells need to mature, branching out to make multiple connections, or \"synapses,\" with other nerve cells. \r\n\r\nThe surface of your baby's brain is very smooth at this stage but as the cortex matures, beginning to form six clear layers, it takes on its familiar wrinkled appearance."

Funny or serious? Happy playing alone or social? Boisterous or quiet? You may believe that babies are born with their personalities already developed, or that they are born with a personality that is further shaped and developed as they grow. The nature versus nurture debate rages on and, in all likelihood, it's a combination of the two: some aspects of your child's personality may already be decided before birth, some may be developed later in childhood, or even adulthood. \r\n\r\nYou may already have noticed that your baby has certain likes or dislikes, for example she may kick or move in response to loud music or to a certain genre of music, though it's difficult to tell whether the increased movements mean your baby is enjoying it or not. \r\n\r\nYour baby is very stimulated inside the uterus. By this third trimester, she can feel vibrations, and hear not just sounds from inside your body, such as your heartbeat, but also sounds from outside, such as people talking. Your baby is aware of when you're moving or are still and you may have noticed a pattern of movements from her, not least that she \"communicates\" more when you're resting. \r\n\r\nAs part of her activity, she will continue practicing for life after the birth, with breathing movements and swallowing-and she may even suck her thumb."

The face, and especially the lips, are extremely sensitive, and this heightened sensitivity provides strong positive feedback as your baby successfully coordinates smooth, purposeful movements between hand (and foot) and mouth. There is still plenty of room in the uterus for all sorts of movements and your baby is extremely flexible. It is quite easy for her to adopt a doubled-up position, with her feet up by her mouth or even on top of her head, and to do full somersaults. \r\n\r\nYour baby's bones are hardening from the center out so their outer edges are still formed of soft cartilage."

You may, in fact, not be dreaming more than usual, but difficulty in finding a comfortable sleeping position and waking often to go to the bathroom may mean that you remember your dreams more than usual (you normally would not wake during the dreaming phase of your sleep cycle, so often do not recall your dreams in the morning). \r\n\r\nIt is common to dream about babies and small children in distress or danger. It is not uncommon for women to feel anxious about such dreams, but you should know that they are in no way insights into what is in store for you.

This is likely to be because when you're busy or distracted, you're less aware of your baby moving because you're not paying much attention to him as at other times. The moment you stop and sit down to put your feet up or go to bed will be the time your baby starts to do his somersaults. \r\n\r\nRemember that, like newborns, babies still in the uterus spend a lot of time sleeping, so there will be periods when you don't feel your baby being very active-it's fine for him not to be moving all the time. Every baby has a different cycle of waking and sleeping, and there are no rules as to when your baby should be kicking and when he should be still. \r\n\r\nIf you're familiar with your baby's pattern of movements and are concerned that you haven't felt him move, try lying down on your side and relaxing or playing music to see if your baby responds. If, however, you're concerned, then call your doctor. She may want you to come in to examine you and listen for the baby's heartbeat. \r\n\r\nSome women count their baby's kicks using a chart, noting down when they feel the baby move. Kick charts are not often used now, unless recommended by a doctor because they are thought to cause unnecessary concern. Babies have an individual pattern of movements, and it is this, rather than the number of kicks, that's important."

Your baby is not in complete darkness, however, because as the uterus grows its wall thins allowing in increasing amounts of light. Now, your baby's eyes have reached a stage of development where they can open. \r\n\r\nEven with the eyelids open, the delicate structures of the eyeballs are protected by a fine membrane that will completely disappear during the final month of pregnancy. \r\n\r\nIt's too early for your baby to respond to light in a fully coordinated way, but he may turn toward very strong lights or, if startled by a sudden loud noise, he will often respond with a blink, just as children and adults do. The retina has just started to be lined by light-receptive rods and cones. The cones are responsible for color vision and develop later than the more numerous rods. The rods transmit an image in black and white and are used for nighttime vision and for peripheral vision. Connections form between the retina and the optic nerve, that then transmits the information it receives to be decoded in the visual cortex at the back of the brain.

You may become more irritated than usual by people who you feel are driving without concern for your safety. \r\n\r\nThis protective instinct is a natural part of becoming a mother. It's the desire to protect and nurture your child, even before yourself. Rest assured, though, that your baby is in the safest possible environment inside your uterus. Your body is providing your baby with warmth, food, and oxygen.

This is often associated with a small amount of fluid around each testis called a \"hydrocele.\" This fluid will disappear naturally either before or after birth. \r\n\r\nThe cremaster muscle, part of the spermatic cord, is able to raise the testes back into the groin. This helps to regulate the temperature within the testes after birth, relaxing when cooling is needed. If your baby is slightly cool when examined, the cremaster muscle retracts the testes giving the impression of an undescended testis in your newborn baby. \r\n\r\nTemperature control is not required in the uterus and the testes slowly move down into the scrotum. It is by no means unusual for one testis (or both) not to have descended at birth. Your doctor will check for this as part of the routine baby development checkup and confirm that both testes can be brought down into the scrotum. \r\n\r\nUnlike the ovary, which already contains all of the egg-producing follicles that it will ever make, the testes do not start to make sperm until puberty. Differences in the speed of growth and weight gain become more apparent now, and boys tend to be slightly heavier than girls at birth."

These movements can vary from gentle paddling motions to feeling as though the baby has hiccups. Sometimes the baby will kick hard; if it's under the ribs it can take your breath away and leave you feeling quite sore. The kicking can also wake you when you're sleeping, and many women say that their babies are more active at night. If you're sitting or lying in a position that the baby doesn't like-for example, if you spend too much time on one side-your baby may well kick until you move. \r\n\r\nAlthough sometimes these movements can be uncomfortable or take you by surprise, most of the time they're just a gentle reminder of your growing baby and, as such, are something to look forward to feeling."

These include the hormone thyroxine, the production of which depends on iodine from the mother crossing the placenta. Thyroxine has several functions and its level needs to be controlled very precisely. The placenta forms a nearly perfect barrier to thyroxine, enabling you and your baby to adjust thyroxine levels independently of each other. In the early stages of pregnancy, genetic factors largely determined the size of your baby, but by now environmental factors are becoming more important. Overall, your baby's final birthweight is determined about 40 percent by genetic factors and 60 percent by environmental factors. Your baby grows at a steady rate from 24 weeks until the last 2-3 weeks, when growth continues but more slowly. (If you're expecting twins, your babies grow as if alone in the uterus up until 28 weeks but from this point there is a reduction in their growth rate.) Your baby's internal organs account for much of his current growth. The liver and brain, in particular, continue to enlarge and muscle mass increases.

This means that constantly scouring the internet and reading everything you find can be confusing and scary. \r\n\r\nArticles telling you that you risk the health and well-being of your baby by doing something can make you feel inadequate. Keep telling yourself that women have been having children for centuries without the aid of the internet! If reading lots of information makes you feel empowered and better able to make informed choices, then read away, but if it makes you feel confused then don't. A sensible course might be to pick just one reliable book or information source to read instead."

Even though you're visiting the hospital so often, you are fit and well; you just also happen to be pregnant. \r\n\r\nAt every prenatal appointment you will be asked for a urine sample, which is checked for protein. If you find it's getting increasingly difficult to catch your sample in the tiny, difficult to hold bottle you're given, don't worry. Only a small amount of urine is needed, so if you can't see anything just start to urinate and then move the bottle underneath the flow to catch some. Urine is sterile so don't worry about getting some on your hands-just wash them thoroughly afterward."

Your baby is born with almost a full complement of neurons, but there is further growth in early childhood. \r\n\r\nFor nerves to function effectively and signals to pass along them faster, they need insulating. In a process known as myelination, the nerves are insulated with myelin sheaths of fat. Although all of the components of the nervous system are present from an early stage of development, the peripheral sensory and motor nerves, spinal cord, and brain need the entire pregnancy to develop and function as a unit. The nerves of the brain and spinal cord carry the sensations of pain, temperature, and touch. However, the process of myelination is ongoing and will not be complete until the final few weeks of pregnancy, so your baby does not register or recognize pain, temperature, and touch at this stage."

This room can still be used for the baby's clothes and any newborn gifts you're given.

This can be a good opportunity to buy some bigger items at a reduced price. If you do buy a second-hand crib, make sure it's certified by the Juvenile Product Manufacturers Association and that the slats are no more than 23\/8 in apart. Hand-me down clothes, sheets, and towels also save money. If this isn't your first baby you may find that you have more or less everything you need, except for disposables, such as diapers. \r\n\r\nAlthough it's good to be prepared (and sometimes babies do arrive early), remember you won't be trapped in your house forever so you don't need to prepare as if for a siege.

From now on, however, the sac will grow by simply stretching rather than forming new cells. \r\n\r\nThe amniotic sac is formed from two distinct layers or membranes, an inner \"amnion\" and outer \"chorion.\" The chorion originally had a blood supply of its own, but this has now been lost. The thinner amnion is able to slide over the chorion as your baby pushes against it. Neither layer contains nerve cells: this explains why it's not painful when your membranes rupture or \"water breaks.\" Combined, the layers are only 0.5 mm thick. Collagen fibers in each layer allow for a great deal of stretch-this is vital in these final months to avoid early rupture of the membranes. Indeed, the membranes may be so resistant to rupture that they don't break until the final stages of your labor.\r\n\r\nIn addition to holding in the amniotic fluid and providing a barrier to possible infection through the cervix, the membranes contain substances that form prostaglandins. Prostaglandins play an important part in the initiation of labor. This is one of the reasons why labor often starts when the membranes have ruptured."

The size of your hips is not always a good indication of the size of your pelvis so having slender hips doesn't mean you'll have a difficult birth, and having larger \"child-bearing\" hips doesn't mean you'll have an easier birth. \r\n\r\nWhat is known is that, although how big your child will be is determined genetically, women have an extra influence on the size of their babies while they are in the uterus. So, even if your child ends up growing to 6 ft (1.80 m) tall, if you're small you'll limit how big she gets in the uterus. This makes sense-if you're small, you wouldn't be able to deliver a hefty 12 lb (5.5 kg) baby, so your body limits the baby's size at delivery. Your baby will then catch up on her expected growth after the birth. \r\n\r\nThere's a condition called cephalo-pelvic disproportion in which the baby is too big or the pelvis is too small for the baby to engage. An MRI scan will be performed to get exact measurements."

This increased blood volume means that your heart is pumping harder and faster. Your blood vessels are as relaxed as they can be by this stage of pregnancy, and will not stretch any further to accommodate this extra blood flow. You may notice that you sweat more, and that your skin feels hotter (this is the rosy glow that many women experience). \r\n\r\nIn addition to this extra blood, there is also a lot more fluid circulating around your body. This makes all your body tissues thicker. It's common and normal for your face, fingers, and ankles to be puffy or swollen (see Swollen feet and ankles).

Things that never bothered you previously, such as standing for long periods of time or walking a lot, may get increasingly difficult. For example, your trip to and from work may tire you much more than it did previously. If that is the case, find out whether you can alter your hours to avoid traveling at the busiest times of the day and, if you find yourself traveling during rush hours, don't be shy about asking someone to give up their seat on the train for you. \r\n\r\nIf there is a room in which you can rest at work, you may be able to take a short nap in the middle of the day or early afternoon, which might help to alleviate your fatigue a little. \r\n\r\nYou may want to discuss with your employer ways to make your job less physically demanding, or ask for help, for example if you need to carry heavy files or your job involves walking long distances.

It's not known whether your own rhythms influence your baby's sleep-wake cycle or whether your baby develops his own internal clock. Indeed, such a clock might be triggered in response to the small amount of light that is able to penetrate through the uterus during the last few weeks of pregnancy. It's apparent from brain scans, however, that by this stage of pregnancy, your baby does have very separate periods of activity. \r\n\r\nThere is a clear cycle, alternating between periods of quiet rest, sleep with rapid eye movements (REM), wakefulness with activity but no eye movement, and wakefulness with lots of activity and eye movements. During this sleep-wake cycle, the baby's actions becomes more coordinated as periods of activity are linked to rhythmical breathing and increased heart rate, and eye movements.\r\n\r\nBy this stage of pregnancy, electrical activity in your baby's brain shows patterns reflecting periods of sleep or wakefulness. An EEG of your baby's brain would show that the quietest period, deep sleep, takes up almost half of the time. The next most common state is REM sleep (the sleep stage during which children and adults dream). This is a time of great electrical activity within your baby's brain. During REM sleep the baby may be quiet or making lots of movements, so it's not possible to tell whether your baby is truly awake at this time or if he's dreaming. Paradoxically, the least electrical activity happens when your baby is most awake-in fact less than 10 percent of your baby's time is spent truly awake at this stage."

This pressure means that women can feel guilty or even depressed if they needed pain relief or a cesarean section, for example. \r\n\r\nBear in mind that some women have higher pain thresholds and can get through labor with simple breathing or relaxation techniques, while others need more help. Pain is subjective, no one else can feel your pain; if it is too much for you, then ask for help. Your options will be explained to you by the doctor. \r\n\r\nChildbirth is hard work, but the experience should not be so painful that it scars you. Being pain-free may mean that you have a more enjoyable, even empowering, labor experience.

You and your baby are designed so that this does not happen. Your baby does not have the ability to produce antibodies (which would attack you) in the uterus: he relies completely on you to protect him from infection, not only in the uterus but also after birth. Protection after birth is possible because antibodies from your immune system cross over the placenta into your baby's bloodstream, while you're pregnant. If you have immunity to a disease such as measles, mumps, polio, and many other severe infections, your baby will carry your antibodies to these conditions. This so-called passive immunity is lost with time and it is for this reason that, from two months onward, your baby will require a program of immunizations to protect against these and other illnesses."

Since the majority of women give birth without needing medical intervention, these centers provide a good alternative to a more medicalized hospital environment. The environment in a birthing center tends to be more relaxed and flexible than a hospital environment. You'll have continuous support from a combination of labor nurses and midwives. Your doctor may also be affiliated with a birthing center. Furthermore, the medical team in these centers is very experienced at handling a birth without medical intervention. All of these factors therefore increase your chances of having a straightforward birth. To be give birth in such a center, you need to have had an uncomplicated pregnancy and be unlikely to require specialized medical care or monitoring in labor and birth.

These red blood cells are unlikely to be of the same blood group as your own. Small numbers of these red blood cells often leak across the placenta; your body recognizes them as foreign and attacks them. \r\n\r\nYour blood group is not important because, although antibodies to blood groups A, B, AB, or O attack your baby's cells in your circulation, they are too large to cross the placenta and attack your baby. Therefore differences in ABO blood groups do not matter. However, everyone is also Rhesus positive (85 percent) or negative (15 percent). If you are Rhesus negative and your partner is Rhesus positive, your baby may also be Rhesus positive. \r\n\r\nRhesus negative women produce antibodies to rhesus positive blood cells; these are smaller than ABO antibodies and can cross the placenta. Once they do, large numbers of antibodies can attack your baby's blood cells, leading to anemia. First pregnancies are rarely affected. In pregnancy you are given an injection of the rhesus antibody \"Rh immunoglobulin (RhIg)\" around now-with another after the birth. The Rh immunoglobulin (RhIg) is in a form that it is too large to cross the placenta. This mops up any of your baby's blood cells in your circulation, preventing your immune system from attacking your baby."

It's good to know, however, that labor has to be well established before you can have an epidural, so you'll still experience some painful contractions. Epidurals generally work well, but sometimes the block isn't complete or is more effective on one side than the other. Some women decide to have an epidural because they know they're unlikely to cope well with labor pain. Many women start off saying that they don't want an epidural and change their minds halfway through-if it's your first pregnancy, you can't possibly know how you'll feel. \r\n\r\nAn elective cesarean is one that is planned and generally performed for medical reasons-for example, because of a low-lying placenta-and not simply because a woman wants to have one. Having a cesarean is major abdominal surgery and in most circumstances it is safer to have a vaginal delivery.

At this stage, the stomach fills every 40 minutes, but, from 35 weeks, as the stomach enlarges, this rate slows down to every 80 minutes. Muscle contractions move the fluid in waves into the small and then large bowel. As it travels along the bowel, water is reabsorbed so that only waste material or \"meconium,\" enters the colon, the final section of the large bowel. This meconium accumulates in the large bowel, which is completely full by the time your baby is born. Babies don't usually pass meconium before the birth but do so soon after.

You may well have had to replace jogging on the treadmill, for example, with going for long, brisk (or not so brisk!) walks. If you find that even walking makes your belly and pelvis sore or uncomfortable, you may find you naturally hold up your belly with your hands to try to give it some extra support and to give your pelvis and back a break. Some women say it feels as if the baby \"might fall out.\" \r\n\r\nYou might want to invest in a pregnancy support band; made of stretchy fabric, this useful item supports the belly and can help prevent lower back pain."

       "tipsDescription":"By this stage of pregnancy, your baby's fingernails have grown and reach the tips of his fingers.\r\n\r\nBy now, your baby's fingernails have reached the tips of the fingers. The fingernails first appeared at 12 weeks, and since the development of the arms is consistently ahead of the legs, the toenails started to develop four weeks later. The future nail begins at the tip of each finger or toe, where a nail fold is formed. At the base of this nail fold, the cells start to harden into nail, in a process known as keratinization. The nails grow from new cells formed in the soft nail bed. It takes nine weeks for the nails to reach the fingertips and it will be another four weeks before the toenails reach the tips of the toes. \r\n\r\nThe nail is actually all the same color, but the white part of the nail appears white because it does not have the nail bed, with its rich blood supply, beneath it to give the illusion of color. Since the nails already reach the fingertips, it probably won't be long after the birth before your baby's nails need trimming-they are very fine and soft and you may find it easier to trim them by nibbling them away rather than trying to cut them. Or cut them with baby nail scissors while your baby is asleep and not wiggling around."

Of course you know that life will continue, but it can be difficult to see past the labor to the realities of life with a newborn. As ever, keep talking to those close to you about how you feel, be it excited or scared and unprepared (usually all three in rapid succession). Talk about what you think or hope it will be like after the baby is born, for example when are grandparents and other key people going to visit, and whether you would like a christening or naming party-or perhaps neither of these.

There are two main types of child care: in and out of your home. In the first case, you can have a live-in or live-out nanny or mother's help, an au pair (which may be acceptable if you work from home, for example, and can supervise), or perhaps a family member or friend who is prepared to come to your house to take care of your baby. If you choose outside child care, there are a number of options including day-care centers, relatives or babysitters in their homes, or on-the-job day care. Before you set your heart on one particular type of care, it's a good idea to investigate the costs and the availability in your area. You may want to pay a visit to some of the nurseries or other facilities close to you, just to get a feel for what's available, and establish now what you do and don't want. Secondly, remember that good-quality child-care facilities and babysitters are usually in demand, and, even if you aren't entirely sure when you will be going back to work, it's probably a good idea to put your baby's name (or last name, at least!) down for a few, to give you options when the time comes."

You might also find that your partner is unable to be there, for example if he is unavoidably going to be out of the country. If you're comfortable with it and feel that you will benefit from someone else being there, then ask away. You can put who you want to be your birth partner or partners on your birth plan. Of course, if you're going to ask someone else other than, or in addition to, your partner to be present, discuss it with him first. He might not be so thrilled at the idea of your mom being present, but explain why you would like her there.

Most singleton pregnancies are 38 to 42 weeks, but if you're carrying twins, 37 to 39 weeks is optimal. But more than half of twins are born before 37 weeks. Women expecting twins are at higher risk of high blood pressure, preeclampsia, placental insufficiency, gestational diabetes, and premature labor. That said, many women do go on to deliver twins naturally and many doctors will allow you to continue to 40 weeks, after which time an induction or cesarean might be suggested. \r\n\r\nIf the babies are in any position other than \"head down,\" or the placenta is in an awkward position, such as near the neck of the uterus, a cesarean may be recommended. Some doctors prefer to deliver twins by cesarean because the second twin may run into difficulties during the delivery, particularly if she is not head down. Premature babies are more at risk of complications than those who go to full-term. A cesarean delivery ensures the babies are delivered quickly without having to go through hours of potentially stressful labor. \r\n\r\nSometimes, one twin is born vaginally and the other by cesarean. This often happens if the lower twin is in the \"head down\" position and the higher twin isn't."

Adequate fluid also allows your baby to move easily since she is in an almost weightless state. There is about 800 ml of amniotic fluid around your baby. The range, however, is quite wide and \"normal\" can be anywhere between 300 ml and 2 liters. Sometimes there is too little, a condition known as oligohydramnios, or too much fluid, a condition known as polyhydramnios, surrounding the baby. In this situation you would be closely monitored and premature delivery may be necessary. \r\n\r\nIt's not surprising that the size of your uterus may not reflect the size of your baby since there can be so much variation in the quantity of fluid. As the amount of amniotic fluid reduces in late pregnancy, your baby is not as well cushioned and her movements may become more obvious, although you should bear in mind that increasingly, as she grows, she has less space in which to move around."

It's true that practice makes perfect and it can take some time to train your mind to relax at will, especially if you are in pain. \r\n\r\nSpend a short period of time as often as you can, every day if possible, practicing your breathing-close your eyes and slow your breathing down, breathing in through your nose and out through your mouth. As you breathe in, imagine your breath entering your body and relaxing you and as you exhale you breathe out any pain or tension. You might want to involve your partner by asking him to breathe with you or count your breathing, a slow count to three or five for every inhale and exhale.\r\n\r\nSome women like to practice using the techniques while pinching their arm temporarily to simulate a contraction-although of course it won't mimic the pain exactly!

Fat is not used as an energy source but it is used for growth. All mineral, vitamin, and calcium needs are met from your own reserves and your diet. Two possible exceptions are iron and folate, a water-soluble vitamin that occurs naturally in foods; folic acid is the synthetic version. Folate does not easily cross the placenta to reach and nourish your baby. Your own iron reserves may already be low if you eat little or no red meat or if this pregnancy has followed on quickly from your last one. Your baby needs iron (and folate) to make red blood cells and because only a small percentage of iron in your diet is absorbed, iron supplementation is often recommended at this stage. \r\n\r\nWhile all of your baby's gut structures were present by 20 weeks, it is not until this stage that all the enzymes needed for digestion are activated and the absorptive surface of the gut is established to a degree that would enable your baby to feed if she were born now."

You may find yourself struggling to get out of bed or out of a chair, and picking something up off the floor can be more difficult than usual. Tasks such as tying your shoelaces or painting your toenails can seem impossible. You can overcome tasks such as these; for example by putting your feet on a stool to tie your shoelaces so you don't have to bend down so far. If you need help, there's no shame in asking.

Don't be shy about asking friends and family members for hand-me-downs. Those who aren't planning any more children will probably be glad to get rid of them. Get together with your women in your prenatal class, and arrange a swap session-many moms may have older children of a different sex than the new baby, and have no need for pink T-shirts, or polo shirts! While the idea of your baby wearing \"used\" clothing may take some getting used to, rest assured that most babywear is hardly worn. \r\n\r\nLook on the internet for end-of-season sales, and even on some of the auction sites, where you can often pick up designer goodies for a fraction of the original price. Visit your yard sales or garage sales. Shop around; you don't have to pay a lot for items such as sleep sacks and will find inexpensive prices in the supermarket. Make a purchase with your weekly grocery shopping and you won't notice the cost as much.\r\n\r\nRemember, too, that you will probably receive numerous gifts of clothing when your baby is born. If you know exactly what you'd like, you may like to create a gift registry from a favorite store or ask people for gift certificates for that store. When looking for more expensive items of clothing, head for the three- to six-month-old rack, so that your baby will get plenty of use out of them.

       "tipsDescription":"Inside the uterus your baby is already practicing the suckling reflex, which will enable him to feed when he's born.\r\n\r\nThe suckling reflex is present earlier in pregnancy but it is known from assessing premature babies that it's usually not until around this time that the baby is strong and coordinated enough to suckle with ease. Your baby regularly practices suckling and this, in combination with the rooting reflex, will enable your baby to feed. \r\n\r\nAfter birth you will see the rooting reflex as your baby turns toward anything that strokes his cheek. The head will turn, and your baby will move his mouth in a series of gradually diminishing circles until the object is found. Once feeding is well established, at about four months, the rooting reflex disappears. From this point on, your baby has much more control over the process, able to turn and directly latch on to the nipple. \r\n\r\nWhile in the uterus, there is no chance of your baby accidentally swallowing amniotic fluid into the lungs. The lungs are already filled with fluid and the high pressure of this, together with your baby's larynx, keeps out amniotic fluid.

Blood leaves the right side of the heart through a one-way valve into the main pulmonary vein. This then divides to give a pulmonary branch to each lung, and also a duct that allows blood to bypass the lungs and travel to the body directly. This will close soon after birth as the lungs expand and their resistance to blood flow falls. \r\n\r\nBecause your baby doesn't use his lungs for gas exchange in the uterus, the blood supply to them is quite small-only 10 percent of the post-birth supply. At this stage of pregnancy, the lungs' blood supply has completed its development, branching into finer and finer vessels as they come to lie closer to the alveoli. \r\n\r\nWhen your baby is born, her chest is compressed in the birth canal and this helps to push the fluid out of the lungs in preparation for that incredible first breath. If your baby is born by cesarean, she will need first to bring the fluid up by herself. This is not a problem but for this reason the first breaths of a baby born by cesarean can be full of mucus."

This can be a relief, but also a time of mixed emotions.\r\n\r\nGoing on maternity leave is a significant pregnancy milestone. As you leave your working role, the reality of beginning your role as a mother may hit you-but you hopefully have a few more weeks to get used to the idea! \r\n\r\nIt can be a welcome respite to take it easy and not have to rush around in the mornings, and you'll feel less tired by not having to travel to work. Although you need to take it easy, it's a good idea to plan some outings, since not having a routine can take some getting used to. Although it's good to stay in touch with colleagues, try not to fall into the trap of logging on to work emails or staying up-to-date with what's happening at work. You might be worrying about losing some of your identity while you're on maternity leave; this is a common feeling but you'll find that before you know it your leave is over and you're settled back into work again. \r\n\r\nTry to enjoy this lead-up to the birth and make the most of the time to get organized and prepare for your new arrival."

The need to provide a safe, comfortable space for your new baby is a primitive desire.\r\n\r\nThe nesting instinct usually begins in the final weeks of pregnancy, accompanied by a surge of energy and an uncontrollable urge to get your home in ship shape. \r\n\r\nGive in to your inner domestic goddess: cook, clean, organize, and de-clutter, but take it easy. If you spend hours on your hands and knees scrubbing, you may find yourself in labor sooner than you'd expected. Some men develop a nesting instinct, but unfortunately this tends to be associated with cars and garden sheds. If this happens to your partner, at least you can look forward to a sparkling-clean car, spruced-up patio, and manicured lawn. \r\n\r\nNesting not happening for you? Pay the professionals to do a spring cleaning. Or forget it: your baby won't care whether the cupboards are clean."

Simple maneuvers, such as fitting through doors or getting off the sofa, can be more difficult and you may find that everything takes a bit longer to achieve. All you can do is be patient and focus on getting through the next few weeks. You'll soon have your body back to normal. \r\n\r\nDuring pregnancy, it's common to eat more often than previously but to eat less at each meal. This is because your uterus has grown so much that all your other organs have moved around and are squashed into much less space. Your stomach simply has less room in it to fit the food so you can't eat as much before feeling full. When your stomach empties you may find yourself hungry again. It's fine to snack, but make sure you're reaching for healthy foods and not the cookie jar!"

Lanugo hairs begin to be shed now since they are lost into the amniotic fluid in the last few weeks before birth. Your baby then swallows these lanugo hairs in the amniotic fluid but this is not a cause for concern: these hairs provide your baby with an important source of protein, essential to his development. It's been estimated that two-thirds of the protein in the fluid is swallowed and absorbed by the baby's gut each day, providing 15 percent of his protein needs. \r\n\r\nThe fine lanugo hairs are gradually replaced by vellus hairs, which are short, soft, nonpigmented hairs (often seen more on women and children). Terminal hair is the thicker, coarser, and longer hair that first grows on your baby's eyebrows, then his eyelashes, then his scalp. In adults, facial hair (beards), armpit, and pubic hair, is terminal hair."

Your baby is not only recognizing a wider range of sound frequencies, but also discriminating between different sounds as well as learning and remembering familiar sounds, such as your voice and that of your partner. \r\n\r\nYour baby breathes more quickly when he's concentrating on sounds and his heart rate increases.

It's also helpful to have your birth partner with you throughout your labor so that he or she can help to fill in any blanks later. Photographs and videos are also good prompts. \r\n\r\nAfter the birth, if you find that there are parts you can't remember, you can ask your doctor to let you see your birth notes.

You and your partner may settle into life with your newborn with ease, and manage without any help, but it's still a good idea to have backup support just in case. \r\n\r\nWhat you may not be prepared for is the fact that you're likely to be exhausted after weeks of poor sleep during pregnancy, and the rigors of labor itself. Add to this interrupted nights' sleep and the whole adjustment to being a new parent, and you may well find you'll need to call on people to help practically and emotionally. \r\n\r\nIt can help enormously to have a good support network set up in advance. Ideally, this will be close family and friends who you know you can rely on to drop in to help, but who will also know when you need to be left alone. Even an hour's help to prepare you a nutritious meal, or hold your baby while you get a much-needed rest or a shower, can give you some welcome respite. \r\n\r\nHave the number on hand for your lactation consultant, so that you can ask for advice. Also get on the phone to moms-to-be whom you've met at prenatal classes; they more than anyone will be able to relate to how you're feeling. \r\n\r\nDon't be too proud to accept help with housework and shopping.

To meet this increase in demand, you absorb calcium much more readily from your diet. \r\n\r\nBy this stage of pregnancy, the baby's humerus in the upper arm, femur in the upper leg, and tibia in the lower leg have undergone this process. As ossification occurs at specific weeks in your pregnancy, ultrasound can use these as markers to estimate the date of the pregnancy, if necessary. \r\n\r\nThe time at which this ossification occurs may be seen a few days earlier in girls than boys and, interestingly, the patella (knee bone), does not ossify until after birth."

An older child might be shocked and jealous by the arrival of a new baby, who appears to steal her limelight, and usurp his mommy and daddy's attention. \r\n\r\nIt's a good idea to prepare your little one several weeks in advance, explaining that the new baby will need a lot of time and attention, will need to be fed and changed regularly, and probably not be much fun for a few months. Focus on how your child can be a great helper, and show her what the new baby will need when she is born. Take some books out of the library that explain how families change when a new baby is born, and ask your child to talk about how she's feeling, and how she thinks things will be different when the baby arrives.\r\n\r\nEncourage your child to choose a gift to give to the baby, and find something your child really wants as a gift from her new sibling.

       "tipsDescription":"Newborn babies can tightly hold someone's finger because of the grasp reflex, and this is already functioning in the uterus.\r\n\r\nInside the uterus your baby has developed a strong grasp reflex. The grip is so strong after birth that it could support your baby's weight. This grasp reflex persists until your baby is about six months old; she will then have more choice over whether to grasp an object or not. \r\n\r\nInterestingly, your baby also has a similar reflex in the foot. This is the \"plantar reflex\" and it causes the toes to attempt to curl around your finger if the sole of the foot is stroked. The plantar reflex takes slightly longer to disappear after birth, typically persisting until 12 months of age. Another reflex action causes the toes to spread out if the side of the foot is stroked. These reflexes and others seem to be quite primitive in nature and although they are thought to protect the baby, the precise function of each reflex is not fully understood."

Remember, however, there's a chance that the scan gave you misleading information. The only way to be absolutely certain of the baby's gender is if you found out following a diagnostic test, such as amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. \r\n\r\nIf you know the sex, you won't have the same incentive of a surprise at the end of your labor, but you may feel you can bond more closely with your baby during pregnancy and picture what he or she will be like as a newborn. \r\n\r\nIf you don't know the sex yet, then you will have a well-earned surprise after your hard work in labor. Some women who don't know the sex of their babies say that they have a strong instinct that the baby is a particular sex, but may be quite surprised when they have a baby of the opposite sex. \r\n\r\nTry to keep an open mind and not raise your hopes about having a baby of a certain gender-the odds are slightly in favor of you having a boy."

Be sensible about the type of activities you undertake, and avoid anything that could be exhausting or potentially dangerous; for example, bear in mind that your center of gravity is way off balance at the moment, and that wallpapering the nursery or carrying heavy groceries should definitely not be on your to-do list. \r\n\r\nIt may feel as though your life is on hold at the moment so that's why it's good to fill your time as best you can.

Although the eyes continue to grow very slightly until adolescence, and the lens within the eye grows throughout life, the eye is three-quarters of its adult size at birth. Both color (cones) and black and white visual cells (rods) are present in the retina but vision is still rather poor-equivalent to being able to just see the top letter of the optician's chart. This is referred to as 20\/400 vision. This means than if the baby could read, then he could read a letter at 20 ft (6 m) that a person with perfect vision could read when 400 ft (122 m) away. Because of this, your newborn may not seem to pay much attention at first; he'll have some difficulty focusing and his eye muscles will be quite weak. He will, however, be able to see objects 12 in (30 cm) away; since this is roughly the distance between your breast and face, it means your baby can see your face as he nurses. \r\n\r\nHe'll be six to eight weeks old before fixing onto and following an object, four months before he can judge distances, and two years of age before his vision has perfected to 20\/20."

REM sleep is closely coupled with periods of increased activity and a faster heart rate.

This process starts in the center of each bone spreading outward. By the end of pregnancy, ossification is complete along the length of each bone but the ends of the long bones and the tips of the bones in the finger and toes remain as cartilage. This is necessary to allow later bone growth as the child develops. \r\n\r\nThe bones in the upper part of the skull are slightly different, developing from membranous structures rather than cartilage. These do not fully fuse until several years after birth and remain separated from each other by connective tissue. This connective tissue forms areas called sutures and where more than two bones meet, wider spaces called fontanelles. Their function is to allow space for movement or \"molding\" between the skull bones making it easier for the head to descend into the pelvis during labor. It is also these suture lines and fontanelles that help your doctor determine the position of the baby's head during labor. After delivery you will notice that your baby's head shape is often elongated, but this soon changes as the bones realign back into their usual positions."

While your baby is in the uterus hiccupping, turning upside down, and trying to coordinate breathing with swallowing, not having much hydrochloric acid in the stomach is a good idea. \r\n\r\nAfter birth the acid content of your baby's stomach will increase quickly in the first 24 hours but not reach adult levels until three months. This is why solids aren't introduced until a baby is at least four months old, although six months is the current advice on when to start weaning. Babies have a reflex to spit out solid food if it's introduced too early and will only be able to take about 20-25 ml of food before the stomach is full. So it's easy to see how the stomach can quickly be overloaded, resulting in spitting up, which is when the baby brings the food and some milk back up."

       "tipsDescription":"You've reached 40 weeks exactly! It may have seemed like a long wait, but it will be worth it once you're holding your baby.\r\n\r\nCongratulations! If you don't yet have your newborn baby in your arms, you soon will, and your life will be changed forever. Even the longest pregnancy seems unaccountably short when your labor begins, and the reality begins to hit that you'll soon be holding your newborn. \r\n\r\nYou'll get through the labor; and you'll forget about the discomfort after a few good sessions detailing it to family and close friends. In fact, everything that precedes that moment when you hold your newborn baby for the first time becomes inconsequential when you realize that you have created the most wondrous thing of all: a new life. So good luck and well done! This is only just the beginning of the most amazing years of your life."
