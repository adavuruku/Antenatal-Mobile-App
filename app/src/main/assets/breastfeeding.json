       "tipDescription":"In many parts of the world, the sight of a nursing mother is an ordinary aspect of daily life. In our society, however, some people are still uncomfortable seeing a mother breastfeed in public. Slowly but surely, though, people are coming to see breastfeeding as the natural, normal way of feeding a baby that it is. And thanks to public education campaigns, people are becoming more knowledgeable about the many benefits of breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nYour legal right to breastfeed\r\n\r\nSociety has conditioned many people to view breasts only from a sexual standpoint and not as a body part with a crucial biological function – to feed a baby. Breastfeeding is the natural default for baby feeding - not bottlefeeding - yet no one harangues a woman who is feeding her baby from a bottle in a public place. If anyone even suggests that you shouldn’t be feeding your baby in public, be aware that you are well within your rights. Keep in mind that it’s the onlooker’s problem, not yours.\r\n\r\nFrom a legal perspective, you have a right to breastfeed your baby in public anywhere in the United States. Some states have gone so far as to implement specific legislation to that effect to protect the rights of both babies and their mothers; these states have set out legal consequences for violations, too. As of this writing, 17 states have passed laws that say you can breastfeed your baby in any public or private location; thirteen more exempt breastfeeding from public indecency laws. This may lead you to believe that the act is legal only in those states with legislation. The fact is, you have a legal right to breastfeed your baby in public even without a specific law. Don’t be shy about letting an impolite person know this. For more information about the legal aspects of breastfeeding in public, check out the website of Elizabeth N. Baldwin, an attorney who specializes in this issue www. compromisesolutions.com.\r\n\r\nIn Canada, the Human Rights Code protects women from discrimination on the basis of sex. Breastfeeding in public is not specifically labeled as a protected activity; however, many people are lobbying to explicitly include breastfeeding under this human rights code.\r\n\r\nWhat about breastfeeding when in foreign countries?\r\n\r\nIt’s best to respect the customs native to the country you are visiting. Even if you think you should breastfeed wherever you please, it’s important to understand and adhere to local customs. If you don't see other women breastfeeding their babies, then ask around. Talk to a woman with young children, ask a health professional, or do a little research. Once you know what is typically acceptable, then you can proceed confidently without risk of offending anyone, breaking a law, or embarrassing yourself.\r\n\r\nGetting comfortable breastfeeding in public\r\n\r\nAlthough you have the right to feed your baby in public, there is still the issue of your feelings about doing so. Each woman has her own comfort level. Most women want to find the right balance of pride and modesty - not overly exposing themselves, while feeling comfortable knowing that people are aware that they are breastfeeding. You’ll probably need some practice with the particulars, simply because breastfeeding is a function that involves a private part of your anatomy that is normally not exposed in public. Wanting to be discreet doesn’t mean that you are embarrassed or ashamed to feed your baby; it simply means that you don’t want to cause yourself or others social discomfort.\r\n\r\nThe biggest issue for most new mothers is learning how to get settled with your baby modestly. Even a new mother who is breastfeeding with ease at home may fumble and struggle when she perceives that she has an audience; her tension then causes her impatient baby to cry. That only deepens the feeling that all eyes are on her. The reality is that most people are paying attention to their own activities and their own private conversations, by and large ignorant of what’s happening with other people. Once you become adept breastfeeding discreetly, you’ll be able to comfortably nurse your baby anywhere. All it takes is a little practice.\r\nPARENT TIP “Always remember that what you are doing is necessary, beautiful, and miraculous. Breastfeed your baby with pride.” - Deborah, mother to Peter (five), Jeremy (three), and Claire (one)\r\n\r\n\r\nTips for breastfeeding in public\r\n\r\nGive yourself permission to feel comfortable about nursing your baby in public. Feeding your baby is a natural, normal part of mothering, whether you are at home or out in public. Dress for breastfeeding. Wear a shirt or sweater that can be lifted up or unbuttoned from the bottom. When you lift from the bottom, the top portion of your shirt helps cover you from the top, and your baby covers you from the bottom. Whatever portion of your breast is shown while feeding your baby is certainly much less than is shown in the typical television show, magazine or at your local beach or public swimming pool. Try a nursing cover-up or a breastfeeding garment with a built-in flap. Many are so beautifully made that even under the most careful scrutiny, they don’t look like nursing clothes. Most stores that sell maternity clothing also sell nursing apparel. Even if you don’t use these at home, they may help you feel more comfortable when in public. Bring along a small baby blanket. Some babies are fine with having a blanket thrown over your shoulder and over their heads, but many are very good at pulling such a blanket off. A good alternative is to bring the blanket up from below, and tent it around your baby, to cover you as you settle your little one to the breast. The blanket can be loosely placed to create privacy, or even removed once you’re settled. Use your sling as a nursing cover-up. Baby slings are wonderful for nursing your baby on the go because they hold your baby perfectly in the nursing position while providing extra fabric for a screen. Some brands have a “tail” at the end that doubles as an extra blanket to keep the baby from trying to peek out while nursing. Feed your baby at the first sign of hunger, because hungry babies aren’t quietly patient! If you wait until your baby is crying to be fed, then you may become nervous; your baby may move about and make the latch-on difficult. Instead, if you nurse him promptly, you can be more relaxed about getting him settled. Remember that the alternative to public breastfeeding is usually public crying. Whether you’re in a restaurant, at church, or on an airplane, people typically would prefer that you feed your baby than let him cry, fuss or otherwise disrupt the peace. I remember once attending a live play with a very antsy two-year-old: my son, David. When I finally settled him on my lap to breastfeed, the gentleman sitting beside me actually said, “Thank you!”"

       "title":"Getting Pregnant While Breastfeeding: FAQ about Fertility and Breastfeeding",
       "tipDescription":"If you are breastfeeding your baby, chances are that you won't be getting pregnant anytime soon. In fact, exclusive breastfeeding has been shown to be 98 percent effective in suppressing ovulation. For the first 6 months of breastfeeding, it is almost impossible to get pregnant again (but not unheard of). The hormones that cause you to produce milk will simultaneously cause you to stop ovulating and having a period. The average amount of time for this halt in fertility is about 14 months, but for some women, fertility can return within 6 months.\r\n\r\nHow can I increase my fertility while breastfeeding?\r\n\r\nProlactin is the hormone that produces milk and suppresses menstruation and ovulation. Once these hormone levels start to drop, you might start ovulating again. Prolactin levels can be lowered if you start reducing feedings. Teaching your baby to sleep through the night without feeding, known as night weaning, will help reduce prolactin levels.\r\n\r\nIf you feed your baby 6-8 times per day, this is usually enough to suppress ovulation. Reducing the number of feedings as your baby develops and is able to take solid foods can help with fertility.\r\n\r\nWhat if I don't have a period?\r\n\r\nThe vast majority of women won't have a period during their first 6 months of breastfeeding. The prolactin hormone will clear from your bloodstream very quickly once you reduce the number of feedings, so expect your period to come back soon if you reduce feedings or start weaning your baby. In 95 percent of cases, your first period after childbirth will not be preceded by ovulation. After you have that first period, though, you should be fertile once again. It will be very difficult to conceive if your baby is less than 6 months of age and you're breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nDo I need to wean my baby?\r\n\r\nWeaning should be a last resort if you want to get pregnant while you're still breastfeeding. Again, night weaning can be very effective in triggering your body to start ovulating again. You can supplement your baby's nutrition with solid foods and reduce feedings during the day, but you don't have to completely stop breastfeeding in order to get pregnant.\r\n\r\nIs breastfeeding safe during pregnancy?\r\n\r\nYour body was made to bear children and to produce milk. Breastfeeding during pregnancy can complicate things a little bit, though, so you'll want to consult with your health care provider. Since your body will be nourishing your breastfeeding baby and the baby that is developing in your womb, it becomes especially important to stick to a healthy diet and eat plenty of nutritious foods. You will need to nourish yourself during this time as well!\r\n\r\nThere is a debate in the medical field as to whether there is an elevated risk of miscarriage or preterm labor for women who breastfeed while pregnant. Very few studies have been done on the issue, but the latest research indicates that there is no theoretical basis to support the claims of increased risk for preterm labor. If you have a history of preterm labor or miscarriage, talk to your primary care provider about getting pregnant while breastfeeding."

       "title":"You Can Still Breastfeed",
       "tipDescription":"Introduction \r\n\r\nOver the years, many, many, many women have been wrongly told to stop breastfeeding. The decision about continuing breastfeeding when the mother must take a drug, for example, involves more than consideration of whether the medication appears in the mother's milk. It also involves taking into consideration the risks of formula feeding for the baby, which are substantial, the risks of not breastfeeding for the mother, which are substantial, and other issues as well.\r\n\r\nFor example, feeding a breastfeeding baby by bottle for the time the mother is on medication (rarely less than 5 days), will very often result in the baby refusing the breast forever or at least becoming very difficult on the breast. On the other hand, it should be taken into consideration that some babies just will not take bottles, so the advice to stop is not only usually wrong, but impractical as well. Furthermore, it is easy to advise the mother to pump her milk when she is not feeding the baby, but adequate pumping is often very difficult to do for some mothers, with the result that the mothers may become very painfully engorged, which may further lead to serious complications. \r\n\r\nBreastfeeding and Maternal Medication \r\n\r\nMost drugs appear in the milk, but only in very tiny amounts. Although a very few drugs may still cause problems for infants even in tiny doses, this is not the case for the vast majority. Mothers who are told they must stop breastfeeding because of a certain drug should ask to be prescribed an alternative medication which is acceptable for breastfeeding mothers. In this day and age, it is rarely a problem to find such an alternative. If the prescribing physician does not know how to proceed, s\/he should get more information. If the prescribing physician is not flexible, the mother should seek another opinion. \r\n\r\nMost drugs may be considered safe for the mother to take and continue breastfeeding if: \r\n\r\nThey are commonly prescribed for infants. Examples are amoxycillin, cloxacillin, most antibiotics. They are considered safe in pregnancy. Drugs enter directly into the baby's bloodstream when used during pregnancy. The baby generally gets much higher doses at a much more sensitive period during pregnancy, than during breastfeeding. This is not an absolute, however, as during pregnancy, the mother's liver and kidneys will get rid of the drug for the baby. They are not absorbed from the stomach or intestines. These include many drugs which are given by injection. Examples are gentamicin, heparin, lidocaine or other local anaesthetics used by dentists. \r\n\r\n\r\nThe following frequently used drugs are also generally safe during breastfeeding: \r\n\r\nacetaminophen (Tylenol, Tempra), alcohol (in reasonable amounts), aspirin (in usual doses, for short periods), most antiepileptic medications, most antihypertensive medications, tetracycline, codeine, most nonsteroidal antiinflammatory medications, prednisone, thyroxine, propylthiouracil (PTU), warfarin, tricyclic antidepressant medications, sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), other antidepressants, metronidazole (Flagyl), Nix, Kwellada. Medications applied to the skin, inhaled or applied to the eyes or nose are almost always safe for breastfeeding. You can still breastfeeding after general, regional or local anaesthesia. As soon as you are up to it. Medications you might take afterwards for pain are almost always permitted. Immunizations given to the mother do not require her to stop breastfeeding (including with live viruses such as german measles, Hepatitis A and B). \r\n\r\nGet reliable information before stopping breastfeeding. Once you have stopped it may be very difficult to restart, especially if the baby is very young. \r\n\r\nBreastfeeding and Maternal Illness \r\n\r\nVery few maternal illnesses require the mother to stop breastfeeding. This is particularly true of infections. Most infections are caused by viruses. Most infections caused by viruses are most infectious before the mother realizes she is sick. By the time the mother has fever (or cold, runny nose, diarrhea, vomiting, rash etc), she has already passed on the infection to the baby. However, breastfeeding protects the baby against infection, and the mother should thus continue breastfeeding, in order to protect the baby. If the baby does get sick, he usually is less sick than if breastfeeding had stopped. But often mothers are pleasantly surprised that their babies do not get sick at all. The baby was protected by his mother's continuing breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nThe only exception to the above is HIV infection in the mother. Until we have more information, it is considered safer for the baby that the mother who is HIV positive not breastfeed, at least where the risks of bottle feeding are acceptable. There are situations, however, even in Canada, where the risk of not breastfeeding is elevated enough that the mother who is HIV positive should nevertheless breastfeed her baby. The final word is not in, however. \r\n\r\nMost other maternal illnesses raise questions because of the drugs the mother might have to take. These should rarely be a problem (see above). \r\n\r\nX-rays and scans: Ordinary X-rays do not require a mother to stop breastfeeding even when used with contrast (e.g. IVP). A CT scan, MRI scan, even when used with contrast do not require a mother to stop. A radioactive scan (e.g. lung scan, bone scan) does not require a mother to stop. The only exception is a thyroid scan. However, most of the time the scan does not have to be done. See below. \r\n\r\nA not uncommon problem in the early months after delivery is a condition called postpartum thyroiditis, a temporary derangement in the thyroid gland's function. A useful test to help understand the condition is a thyroid scan. However, the test requires that radioactive iodine be given to the mother and this material must not be given to nursing mothers. The radioactive iodine will be found in the milk for weeks, and concentrated in the baby's thyroid. There are ways of dealing with postpartum thyroiditis without doing this test. The drugs a mother might have to take to treat postpartum thyroiditis are compatible with continued breastfeeding (e.g. propranolol, propylthiouracil) \r\n\r\nBreast Problems \r\n\r\nMastitis (breast infection) and breast abscess are not reasons to stop breastfeeding. Although surgery on a lactating breast is more difficult, the surgery does not necessarily become easier if the mother stops breastfeeding, as milk continues to be formed for weeks after stopping breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nMammograms are more difficult to read if the mother is breastfeeding, but can still be useful. Once again, how long must a mother wait for her breast no longer to be considered lactating? Evaluation of a lump can be done by other means besides mammography. Discuss options with your doctor. Let him\/her know breastfeeding is important to you. A needle biopsy, for example, can be done of a lump which is of concern. \r\n\r\nNew Pregnancy \r\n\r\nThere is no reason that you cannot continue breastfeeding if you become pregnant. There is no evidence that this does any harm to you, to the baby in your womb or to the one who is nursing. If you wish to stop breastfeeding, take your time and wean slowly. \r\n\r\nInfant Problems \r\n\r\nBreastfeeding rarely needs to be discontinued for infant illness. Through breastfeeding, the mother is able to comfort the sick child, and, at the same time, the child is able to comfort the mother. \r\n\r\nDiarrhea and vomiting. Intestinal infections are rare in exclusively breastfed babies. (Though loose bowel movements are very common in exclusively breastfed babies). The best treatment for this condition if the baby gets it, is to continue breastfeeding. The baby will get better more quickly on breastmilk. The baby will do well with only breastmilk in the vast majority of situations, and will not require added fluids except in extraordinary cases. \r\n\r\nRespiratory illnesses. There is a medical myth that milk should not be given to children with respiratory infections. Whether this is true or not for milk, it is definitely not true for breastmilk (and breastfeeding). \r\n\r\nJaundice. Exclusively breastfed babies are commonly jaundiced, even until the 3rd month, though generally the yellow colour of the skin is hardly noticeable. Rather than being a problem, this is normal. (There are causes of jaundice which are not normal, but these do not require stopping breastfeeding). If breastfeeding is going well, jaundice does not require the baby to stop breastfeeding. If breastfeeding is not going well, fixing the breastfeeding will improve the jaundice, whereas stopping breastfeeding even for a short time may completely destroy the breastfeeding. Stopping breastfeeding is not the answer. (See handout #7 Breastfeeding and Jaundice). \r\n\r\nIf the question you have is not discussed above, do not assume that you must stop breastfeeding. Do not stop, and get more information. Mothers have been told they must stop breastfeeding for reasons too inane to discuss. \r\n\r\nHandout #9. You Can Still Breastfeed.

       "title":"Breastfeeding Myths",
       "tipDescription":"Congratulations mom! You are undoubtedly getting baby advice from all sorts of people, no matter how old your baby is-possibly even if you haven't delivered yet. It can be overwhelming, especially when the conflicting advice is about something you are already nervous about-like breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nThere are many, many myths out there about breastfeeding. If you are in need of breastfeeding assistance, La Leche League is ready to help, and your local group will also have contact information for lactation consultants if your pediatrician is unable to give you the help you need. \r\n\r\nAnd, though every baby is different, breastfeeding often (at least 8 times a day) in the first two weeks of life helps regulate your milk supply to baby's needs-no matter what conflicting advice you may get.\r\n\r\nSome Common Breastfeeding Myths\r\n\r\nIt's normal for nursing to hurt\r\nThough nursing is often uncomfortable at first, continued pain is a sign that baby is not latching on properly. Try changing positions or seeing your doctor or a lactation consultant for guidance. \r\n\r\nNursing will cause your breasts to sag \r\nActually, it's more likely the pregnancy hormones! \r\n\r\nDoctors know everything about breastfeeding \r\nSome pediatricians or Ob-Gyns may be breastfeeding experts, but others know very little. Get a second opinion if you don't feel supported by your doctor, or contact a lactation consultant.\r\n\r\nYou can't get pregnant while nursing \r\nYou are less likely to conceive in the first six months of exclusive breastfeeding-but never say never! It is possible to get pregnant during your first cycle postpartum, before you have a period. Use a barrier method if you don't want to take any oral medications or hormones for birth control.\r\n\r\nSome babies are allergic to their mother's milk \r\nNot exactly-some babies are allergic to a protein in the milk from something their mother has eaten. The problem is solved when mom stops eating the offending food. Actual allergy to mother's milk is very, very rare and usually discovered in the first weeks of life.\r\n\r\nPoor milk supply is caused by stress, fatigue, or inadequate nutrition \r\nPoor milk supply is usually caused by infrequent nursing or poor position\/latch-on in the baby. Increase the number of nursing sessions, change positions, or see your doctor or a lactation consultant if baby continues to have trouble latching on or if your milk supply diminishes. \r\n\r\nFrequent nursing results in poor milk supply \r\nActually, baby's nursing tells your body that baby is hungry, and frequent nursing builds up your milk supply as your body makes more milk to meet baby's needs. Babies that are undergoing a growth spurt will nurse more, causing your body to make more milk, which then provides the additional calories and nutrition that baby needs. \r\n\r\nMom only needs to nurse baby 4-6 times a day to maintain milk supply \r\nSince your body makes milk based on baby's needs, intentionally restricting feedings will actually decrease milk supply. However, an older baby or toddler may actually feed fewer than four times a day, as much of their nutritional needs will be met through solid foods. \r\n\r\nBreastfeeding moms should space feedings so the breasts can refill \r\nThe emptier the breast, the faster your body will refill it. The fuller the breast, the more production slows as your body adjusts. Feed baby when he\/she shows signs of hunger to maintain the needed supply for your baby."

       "title":"Diflucan (Fluconazole) Treatment",
       "tipDescription":"Fluconazole (DiflucanT) is a synthetic antifungal agent which can be used for the treatment of a variety of Candida albicans infections. For the breastfeeding mother in particular, it can be used to treat recurrent Candida infections of the nipples, and, if such an thing exists, as I believe it does, Candida infections of the milk ducts.\r\n\r\nCandida (yeast) infections of the nipple and ducts\r\n\r\nCandida infections of the nipples may occur any time while the mother is breastfeeding. Candida albicans likes warm, moist, dark areas. It lives normally on us, and 90% of babies are colonised by it within a few hours of birth. It only becomes a problem under certain circumstances. Candida infections of the skin or mucous membranes are more likely to occur when there is a breakdown in the integrity of the skin or mucous membrane-another reason why a good latch is very important from the very first day. Many Candida infections would, perhaps, not have occurred, if the mother had not had sore nipples and a breakdown of the skin of the nipples and areola. The oozing of serum which occurs often in cracked nipples turns Candida albicans from its harmless form to a disease causing form.\r\n\r\nThe widespread use of antibiotics also encourages the overgrowth of Candida albicans. Many pregnant women, women in labour, and new mothers, as well as their babies receive antibiotics, sometimes with very little justification.\r\n\r\nDiagnosis of Candida infections of the nipples and\/or ducts\r\n\r\nThere is no good test which helps makes the diagnosis. A positive culture from the nipple(s) proves little. Neither does a negative culture. The best way to make a diagnosis is by history.\r\n\r\nThe presence or absence of a Candida infection in the baby is not helpful. A baby may have thrush all over his mouth, but the mother have no pain. A mother may have the classic symptoms of a Candida infection of the nipples, and the baby have no thrush or diaper rash.\r\n\r\nThe typical symptoms of a Candida infection of the nipples are:\r\n\r\nNipple pain which begins after a period of pain free nursing. Though there are a few other causes of nipple pain which begin later, Candida infection is definitely the most common. The nipple pain of Candida may begin without an interval of pain free nursing, however.\r\n\r\nBurning nipple pain which continues throughout the feeding, sometimes continuing after the feeding is over.\r\n\r\nPain in the breast which is \"shooting\" or \"burning\" in nature and which goes through to the mother's back and shoulder. This pain is usually worse toward the end of the feeding, and worsens still more after the feeding is over. It also tends to be much worse at night. This pain may occur without any nipple pain.\r\n\r\nPain, as above, which is made much better with the use of gentian violet.\r\n\r\nTreating Candida Infections\r\n\r\nOur first approach to treating these infections is gentian violet (handout #6 Using Gentian Violet) plus all purpose nipple ointment (handout #24 Treatments for Problems). This approach is safe, works rapidly, and almost always, though there seems to have been a decrease in the effectiveness of gentian violet over the past few years. For this reason, I now use a combination. A good response to gentian violet confirms that the mother's nipple pain is caused by Candida since little else will respond to gentian violet. It thus also justifies the use of fluconazole, if needed.\r\n\r\nFluconazole\r\n\r\nFluconazole is an antifungal agent which is taken systemically (taken by mouth or intravenously). It is fungistatic, which means that it stops fungi (such as Candida albicans) from multiplying, but does not actually kill them. This accounts for the fact that sometimes it takes several days to have an effect.\r\n\r\nSide Effects\r\n\r\nFluconazole is generally well tolerated, but there is no such thing as a drug which never has side effects. Concern about liver injury is exaggerated, since this complication seems quite rare, and usually occurs in people who are taking other medications as well, and who have taken fluconazole for months or longer, and who have immune deficiencies. But it is a possibility that needs to be kept in mind and if it does occur, it can be very serious. Vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain and skin rashes are the most common side effects. These are not usually severe, and only occasionally is it necessary to stop the medication because of these side effects. Allergic reactions are possible but uncommon. Call immediately if you have any concerns. \r\n\r\nFluconazole in the milk\r\n\r\nFluconazole does appear in the milk, and this is as it should be, since the idea is to treat infection in the ducts and nipples. It is thus superior to ketoconazole, which gets into the milk in only tiny amounts. The baby will obviously get some, but this drug is now being promoted for use in babies for the treatment of simple thrush. There have been no complications in the baby reported from exposure to fluconazole in the breastmilk. Continue breastfeeding while taking fluconazole, though you may be told you cannot.\r\n\r\nDose of fluconazole\r\n\r\nCandida albicans is learning to become resistant to fluconazole, and the dose we use has increased over the past few years. Only a few years ago, 100 mg daily for 10 days cured 90% of women of their symptoms. We have now found this to be inadequate. For resistant cases, a newer antifungal agent, itraconazole, can be used, though it may not be the answer either, as it does not have a very powerful effect against Candida. Your prescription will be for fluconazole 400 mg as a first dose, followed by 100 mg twice daily for at least two weeks. If you have nipple pain continue with the \"all purpose nipple ointment\" while you are taking fluconazole. We like the mother to be symptom free for at least a week before stopping the medication. This seems, on the basis of our experience, a\r\n\r\nfairly good guarantee against relapse. However, this means that although most mothers require only the usual two weeks, some need longer treatment. Occasionally it may take up to a week for the pain to even start going away\r\n\r\n. Call if there is no relief in seven days. \r\n\r\nIt is sometimes useful to treat the baby as well. The dose for the baby would be 6 mg\/kg as a first dose, followed by 3 mg\/kg\/day as one dose for the same period of time as the mother.\r\n\r\nJack Newman, MD, FRCPC is a pediatrician, a graduate of the University of Toronto medical school.

       "title":"How to Increase Your Milk Supply: 35 Ways to Boost Your Milk Supply",
       "tipDescription":"In order to understand how to increase your milk supply it is important to understand how the process of milk production works. You may have heard that breast milk supply is based on supply and demand, but milk production isn’t initially based on supply and demand. After you give birth, hormones in your body tell your breasts to start making milk. During this time period your body doesn’t know exactly how much milk your baby will need. This is the best time to establish a good milk supply. \r\n\r\nOver time, your body eventually learns how much milk to produce based on the removal of milk from your breasts. When your breasts are empty, this tells your body to make more milk. Likewise, full breasts signal your body to make less milk. Emptying the breasts frequently during the early stages of breastfeeding will help ensure that you have a good milk supply. But what can you do if breastfeeding didn’t get off to a good start or if you want to increase your milk supply?\r\n\r\nHere are 35 ways to boost your milk supply:\r\n\r\n1. Breastfeed frequently. Frequent breastfeeding is the number one key to boosting your milk supply. \r\n2. Offer both breasts during feedings.\r\n3. Make sure baby nurses long enough to empty your breast when she nurses.\r\n4. Don’t schedule feedings. Follow your baby’s hunger cues for feeding.\r\n5. Allow your baby to cluster feed. Cluster feeding is when a baby breastfeeds several times during a short period of time. Babies often cluster feed in the evenings before they go to sleep.\r\n6. Try switch nursing. Nurse on one breast, if baby gets tired of nursing switch to the other breast, and continue switching breasts until both breasts are empty or baby will no longer suck.\r\n7. Use breast compression when you nurse. Breast compression involves massaging your breast and squeezing extra milk out as your baby nurses.\r\n8. Breastfeed at night. Night feedings are great for boosting milk supply.\r\n9. Pump after nursing. Usually pumping after nursing will help empty the breast. If you find that you are not pumping anything after nursing you can try pumping before nursing. Babies are much more efficient at emptying the breast than a pump so this may work better for some moms.\r\n10. If your supply is low or baby is not gaining weight see a lactation consultant for help.\r\n11. Make sure baby is latching on well. Try more than one technique to get your baby latched on.\r\n12. Get support from breastfeeding moms.\r\n13. Pump while you nurse. Pump on one side and nurse on the other. Then switch sides and let baby empty the breast that you pumped.\r\n14. Get lots of skin to skin contact with baby.\r\n15. Nurse in bed. Lying down in bed may help you relax and allow baby to nurse for longer periods of time.\r\n16. Don’t sleep on your stomach at night. This may compress your breasts and hinder your supply.\r\n17. Let your baby comfort nurse even if you don’t hear her swallowing.\r\n18. Try babywearing. Carry your baby in a sling or try nursing her in the sling.\r\n\r\n19. Avoid pacifiers and artificial nipples\r\n20. Avoid taking birth control pills while you are breastfeeding if possible.\r\n21. Don’t smoke.\r\n22. Drink plenty of water, especially right before you nurse.\r\n23. Limit how much caffeine you drink.\r\n24. Try to relax when you nurse and not rush.\r\n25. Avoid supplementing if at all possible.\r\n26. Eat a healthy diet with plenty of protein.\r\n27. If your baby needs to supplement, consider using a supplemental nursing system or lactation aid so that your baby can nurse at the breast while you supplement.\r\n28. Take a nursing vacation. Spend a weekend in bed with your baby and nurse her as much as possible.\r\n29. Try taking fenugreek or blessed thistle. Both our herbs that have been used to help improve milk supply.\r\n30. Try drinking mother’s milk tea. Mother’s milk tea can be found at most health stores.\r\n31. Don’t diet while you are breastfeeding.\r\n32. Eat a bowl of oatmeal. Some moms believe oatmeal helps boost milk supply.\r\n33. Talk to your doctor about prescription medication like Reglan to boost your milk supply.\r\n34. Avoid decongestants and antihistamines as these may decrease milk supply.\r\n35. Remember that any amount of breast milk your baby gets from you is good for her."

       "title":"Using a Lactation Aid",
       "tipDescription":"Introduction \r\n\r\nA lactation aid is a device which allows a breastfeeding mother to supplement her baby with expressed breastmilk, formula or glucose water with added colostrum (glucose water alone should only be used, in general, in the first day or two after birth) without using an artificial nipple. The early use of an artificial nipple may result in the baby becoming \"bottle spoiled\" or \"nipple confused\" because it interferes with the way a baby latches on to the breast.\r\n\r\nThe better a baby latches on, the easier it is for him to get milk. If the baby does not get milk well from the breast, he may fall asleep or push away from the breast when the flow of milk slows down. Thus the baby may refuse the breast, be very fussy at the breast, gain weight poorly, lose weight or even become dehydrated. The mother may develop sore nipples. Though artificial nipples do not always cause problems, their use when things are already going badly will rarely make things better, and usually make things worse. The lactation aid is by far the best way to supplement, if the supplement is truly necessary. (However, proper latching on of the baby usually allows the baby to get more milk, and thus it is often possible to avoid the supplement). It is better than using a syringe, cup feeding, finger feeding or any other method, since the baby is at the breast and breastfeeding. Babies, like adults, learn by doing. Furthermore, the baby supplemented at the breast is also getting breastmilk from the breast. \r\n\r\nA lactation aid consists of a container for the supplement-usually a feeding bottle with an enlarged nipple hole-and a long, thin tube leading from this container. Manufactured lactation aids are available and are easier to use in some situations, but not necessarily so. Manufactured lactation aids are particularly useful when the need for a lactation aid arises in an older baby, when a mother needs to supplement twins, when the need for a lactation aid will be long term, or whenever difficulty arises using the improvised lactation aid. Though the manufactured lactation aid is not inexpensive, the cost is about equal to 2 weeks of the usual milk based formula. \r\n\r\nPlease Note: Using a tube with a syringe, with or without a plunger, instead of the setup mentioned above, seems unnecessarily complicated and adds nothing to the effectiveness of the technique. On the contrary, it is more cumbersome. \r\n\r\nUsing the Lactation Aid (Improvised) \r\n\r\nThe baby may be latched on to the breast first, and the tube slipped into the baby's mouth at the appropriate time. The better the latch, the better the baby will get your milk and the easier the aid will be to use, and the more quickly you will be able to get rid of the supplements. The breast should be gently eased out of the way so that the corner of the baby's mouth is seen, and the tube, held between the index finger and thumb, should be slipped into the corner of the baby's mouth so that it enters straight towards the back of the baby's mouth and at the same time, upwards towards the roof of the mouth. The tube is well placed when the supplemental fluid works its way down the tube at a rather rapid rate. There is usually no need to fill the tube with supplemental fluid before putting it into the baby's mouth. Or, the baby is latched on to the breast and the tube, which is run along the mother's breast and nipple, at the same time. The better the baby's latch, the easier the lactation aid is to use. Also, the better the latch, the more likely and the more rapidly the baby will be able to do without the lactation aid. Therefore, proper positioning and latching on of the baby are still very important. The tube may be taped to the breast if the mother desires, though this is not really necessary and not always helpful. The tube does not need to pass the end of the nipple and needs to be only just past the baby's gums to function properly. It does seem to function better if the tube is placed in the corner of the baby's mouth and enters straight into the baby's mouth over the tongue. (Point it to the roof of the baby's mouth). It is occasionally helpful for the mother to hold the tube in place with her finger, as some babies tend to push the tube out of position with their tongues. The bottle containing the supplement should not ordinarily be higher than the baby's head. If the lactation aid functions only when the bottle is held higher than the baby's head, something is wrong. Keep the bottle higher only if this is suggested by the doctor or lactation specialist. Unless otherwise instructed, it is best to use the tube with every feed, though some mothers find it easier not to use it during the night. Do not cut off the end of the tube. It works fine as it is. It should not take an hour for the baby to drink an ounce of milk from the lactation aid. If it is taking this long, the tube is probably not well positioned, or the baby is poorly latched on, or both. When the lactation aid is functioning well, it takes 15-20 minutes, usually less, for the baby to take an ounce of the supplement. \r\n\r\nCleaning the Device \r\n\r\nDo not boil the tube of the non-manufactured aid. It is not made to be boiled. After using the device, clean the bottle and nipple as usual. Do not boil the tube. The tube should be emptied after use and then rinsed through with hot water (suck up hot water into the tube from a cup) and then hung up to dry. Soap, though not necessary, may be used if desired, but rinse the tube well. Tubes may become stiff and unsuitable for use after about a week. \r\n\r\nWeaning the Baby from the Lactation Device \r\n\r\nMaintain contact with the breastfeeding clinic for advice about weaning the baby from the lactation aid. Weaning the baby from the aid may take several weeks or only a short while. Do not be discouraged and do not try to force the weaning. Usually, the amount of milk required in the lactation aid increases over 1-2 weeks, then levels out for a variable period of time before decreasing. The whole process may take 2-8 weeks, although some mothers have used the device only a few days, whereas others have not been able to stop it at all. Rapid improvement sometimes occurs after a long period of little change. Breast Compression) to keep the baby drinking; then repeat the process on the second breast. You can return to the first breast and continue back and forth as long as the baby is drinking. After you have finished feeding on both breasts, insert the tube into the baby's mouth. Allow the baby to nurse until satisfied using the lactation aid. The bottle of the lactation aid can be lowered 6-12 inches below the baby's head, but do this only if the baby is drinking very quickly. \r\n\r\nHandout #5. Lactation Aid.

       "title":"Beginner's Guide to Exclusive Pumping",
       "tipDescription":"There are different reasons why women choose to feed their baby exclusively with pumped breast milk. Some pump because of personal preferences. Others choose exclusive pumping because their baby has had issues with breastfeeding such as not latching, tongue tie, cleft palate, or other problems. Giving your baby breast milk, whether it is from breastfeeding or pumping, is one of the best ways to give your baby a healthy start. Breast milk provides your baby with the best nutrition and has many other benefits including boosting his immune system, lowering his risk of obesity, cancer and other diseases, and possibly improving his IQ. If you have made the choice to provide your baby with breast milk, you may have a lot of questions. We’re here to help you get started. \r\n\r\nExclusive pumping supplies:\r\n\r\nDouble electric pump Hands-free kit (not necessary, but nice to have) Breast milk storage bags Bottles Nursing bra and nursing pads \r\n\r\nBecause exclusive pumping is more demanding than just pumping on occasion, you really need a good quality pump to be successful. Most moms use a double electric pump like the Medela Pump in Style or Freestyle, or the Ameda Purely Yours. You can also rent a hospital grade pump like the Medela Lactina. Some women are able to pump with a manual pump or a single electric pump. The Avent Isis and Medela Harmony are both good manual pumps. However, most women who pump exclusively don’t pump enough milk with a manual pump. When it comes to pumping for your baby, the pump truly makes a difference. A quality pump can allow you to pump significantly more. Take time to research how each breast pump works, how closely it mimics breastfeeding, and what other moms have to say about it.\r\n\r\nPumping routine: How often and how much?\r\n\r\nPumping should simulate breastfeeding as much as possible. You want to empty your breasts as frequently as you would if your baby was nursing. Emptying your breasts frequently is the best way to establish and maintain a good milk supply. Breastfed newborns nurse every 2 to 3 hours (around 8 to 12 times a day). They can nurse for as little as 10 minutes at a feeding to as long as 40 minutes, or more. Thus to mimic your baby’s feeding patterns, you will want to pump for around 15 to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours during the day and every 3-4 hours at night. \r\n\r\nIt’s difficult to say how much you will pump per session. Some women have a larger storage capacity than others and store more milk between feedings. The average woman can expect to pump around 3 to 5 oz per session, for a total of around 24 to 40 oz per day. Your baby will need around around 25 to 30 oz per day until he is around 6 months old. After 6 months, your baby may start to take less expressed breast milk once solids are introduced. You can use JM’s breastfeeding calculator to estimate how much breast milk your baby will need. (*JM’s breastfeeding calculator is intended for baby’s six months or younger.)\r\n\r\nPump settings\r\n\r\nIn order to maximize the amount of breast milk you pump, experiment with your pump settings. You want to mimic baby’s breastfeeding patterns. Babies suck really fast at the beginning of a feeding to stimulate a let down, so you should start off with the speed set to high and the suction set to low. Once you feel a let down and your milk starts flowing, slow the speed of your pump down and increase the suction to a comfortable level. If your milk output slows down, change your settings back to a faster speed to stimulate a second let down and decrease the suction. Then lower the speed again and increase the suction once your milk starts flowing again.\r\n\r\nDropping pumping sessions\r\n\r\nOnce your milk supply is well-established, usually around the time your baby is 12 weeks old, you may be able to decrease the number of times you pump in a day. There is more than one approach to dropping sessions. Some women simply skip a pumping session. Others gradually increase the length of time between pumping sessions. While others reduce the amount of time pumped during a session until it is completely eliminated. You can use whichever approach works best for you but make sure you eliminate sessions gradually. Once you eliminate a session or make changes to your pumping routine, evaluate the impact it has on your milk supply. If you find your total output hasn’t changed much, you can continue decreasing the number of times you pump gradually. However, if you see that your milk supply has decreased, you may need to increase the number of times you pump per day. Some women can produce the same amount of milk in 5 or 6 sessions, where others may need to continue pumping every 2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\nStoring breast milk\r\n\r\nBreast milk can be stored in the refrigerator for 3 to 8 days, in a traditional freezer for up to 4 months, and in a deep freezer for as long as a year. You will want to feed your baby fresh breast milk as much as possible, but any excess can be stored in the freezer and thawed later. It’s a good idea to store your breast milk in 3-4 oz bags. If your baby takes more than 4 oz at a feeding, fill your bags to around the amount he would take in one feeding. Keep in mind though, that once it is thawed it cannot be refrozen. (See JM’s Breast Milk Storage Guidelines for more information on storing breast milk.) \r\n\r\nTo thaw frozen milk, you can either leave it in the fridge overnight or run it under warm tap water. Do not microwave as the microwave does not heat liquids evenly. This creates hot spots that can scold your baby’s mouth and throat. The microwave also destroys some of the immunological properties in breast milk.\r\n\r\nPower pumping, tips for increasing your supply, and other tips\r\n\r\nOne of the best ways to increase your milk production is to pump more frequently. If you are not producing enough milk for your baby or are struggling to keep up with his needs, the first thing you can try is pumping more frequently. Frequency is more important than how long you pump. So, try upping your pumping sessions to every two hours until you see an increase in output. \r\n\r\nHere are some other tips.\r\n\r\nPower pumping: Breast milk production works on supply and demand. Power pumping is one way you can increase your milk supply. Pick a time when you will be able to relax and pump frequently. Spend about an hour a day pumping for ten minutes then resting for ten minutes, so that you pump around 3 to 4 times with ten minute intervals of rest in between. Power pump for around an hour a day for a few days in a row or until you notice an increase in output. Power pumping is similar to what your body would experience during a cluster feeding or growth spurt, and may help improve your milk supply. Try power pumping in the morning as milk production is often greater in the morning. Try using galactagogues. Galactagogues are herbs and foods that can increase your milk supply. Drink plenty of water. Drinking a large cup of water an hour or so before you pump can help you to be better hydrated and to pump more milk. Try breast massage and compression. Before you begin to pump, massage your breasts and roll your nipples with your fingers. This will help to stimulate a let down. If your milk flow slows down during pumping, take a quick break and massage your breasts and nipples until they feel tingly. Then pump again. Store your breast shields in the refrigerator between use. This way you can just wash them at the end of the day. \r\n\r\nFor more tips and advice on pumping visit JustMommmies Pumping Mommies message board."

       "title":"Breastfeeding and Returning to Work",
       "tipDescription":"Not too long ago, it was almost unheard of for a mom to breastfeed and work full time. Formula feeding was the standard for working moms but now many moms are breastfeeding and working full time. Choosing to breastfeed no longer means sacrificing your career. Breast pumps are more affordable and easier to purchase. You can purchase a breast pump for as little as $40 that is suitable for using at work. With more and more women choosing to breastfeed and work, the tide is turning in the workplace. More companies are accommodating moms and even providing nursing stations for their employees to pump while at work.\r\n\r\nBreast pumps for returning to work\r\n\r\nIf you are returning to work you will need a quality breast pump. If you are only working part time a small hand pump like the Avent Isis will be perfect. It has a great reputation with working moms, is affordable, lightweight, and easy to use. In fact, some women will use two Avent hand pumps to double pump and get the same results as using an expensive double pump. If you plan to return to work full time, you will probably want to invest the money in an electric double pump like Medela Pump in Style or Ameda Purely Yours. You can purchase a double electric pump for around $200, depending on the brand you choose. Double electric pumps are designed for moms that are working full time or are away from baby for several hours during the day. These breast pumps are designed to mimic baby’s sucking. Suction pressure and cycling rate can be adjusted to simulate baby nursing. Another option for working moms is renting a hospital grade pump. You can rent a hospital grade pump for around $30-$40 a month. Hospital grade pumps are higher quality pumps and may be a good option for moms who are not sure if they want to work and pump. See our breast pump reviews for more help in deciding which pump is best.\r\n\r\nSupplies for breastfeeding and working\r\n\r\nNursing braNursing apparel (you can wear clothes that are designed with easy open flaps for breastfeeding or regular clothes. Dresses or suits may not be practical if they are not designed for breastfeeding) Breast pumpBack up hand pump (it’s a good idea to keep a back up hand pump in your car or at work in case of emergencies)Extra parts (valves, tubing, seals, etc. A cracked seal on your breast pump will put you out of business. Keep extra parts inside your pump in case you need them.)Cooler or ice chest Storage bags or containers to store breast milkBottles for baby (small four oz and two oz bottles are great)Slow flow nipples for bottles (Choose the appropriate nipple flow for your baby’s age. Slow flow nipples help with nipple confusion.)\r\n\r\nHow much breast milk will you need for your baby while you are at work?\r\n\r\nTo figure out how much breast milk your baby needs multiply your baby’s weight times 3 oz. This will tell you approximately how much breast milk your baby needs over a 24-hour period. You can use our breastfeeding calculator to determine how much milk you will need for your baby when you return to work.\r\n\r\nHow much breast milk should you plan to freeze in advance?\r\n\r\nThe more milk you have stored in a freezer stash, the better. You can start pumping as soon as your milk comes in. You probably want to wait for a week or so until you are no longer producing colostrums. Don’t be surprised if the first time you pump you produce nothing or very little. Milk production works by supply and demand. It takes several days before your body will get the signal to make more milk for your pumping session. The best advice would be to pump around the same time each day, preferably in the morning when your body’s milk production is the best. Once you have been pumping consistently you should start to produce milk for your freezer stash.\r\n\r\nHow much breast milk do most women pump?\r\n\r\nPumping amounts vary. Some women can pump as much as 8 oz per breast and others only produce 1-2 oz per breast. The average woman will pump around 3-4 oz from both breasts during a pumping session.\r\n\r\nHow do you thaw and prepare breast milk?\r\n\r\nBreast milk can be stored in the freezer or refrigerator. Storage guidelines for breast milk vary but you can safely store breast milk in your freezer for around three months. Frozen breast milk can be thawed in the refrigerator over night or thawed in warm tap water. Do not warm in the microwave or refreeze breast milk. Microwaving or refreezing will destroy components in the breast milk that your baby needs. You will notice that the milk will separate when it is in the refrigerator. This is normal. The fat will rise to the top. This does not mean that the milk is spoiled.\r\n\r\nPreparing for returning to work\r\n\r\nBefore you return to work you should talk to your employer and tour your workplace. You will want to have a place where you can pump that is clean and private. Talk to your employer about possibly places that you can pump. Be confident and don’t worry about what your boss will think. Most of the time this is no big deal. You may spend time unnecessarily worrying about this and your boss may not think anything about it. Usually this goes over better than expected. Sometimes moms settle for pumping in the bathroom without even having a conversation with their employer. Pumping in the bathroom is not a good solution. Once you have found a few options for places to pump talk it over with your employer and see how it goes. If for some reason your direct supervisor is not cooperative, check with your company’s human resource manager or state labor department for options. Most employers are cooperative with breastfeeding moms.\r\n\r\nStart offering your baby a bottle a couple weeks before you return to work. Some babies don’t like to take a bottle from mom so you may want to have dad or your caregiver offer her a bottle instead. You may want to try a few test runs with your caregiver before you return to work. See how baby responds to being away from mom, how she takes the bottle, and how you feel about your caregiver. Returning to work is a hard adjustment for mom and baby. If the test run doesn’t go well you may want to postpone your return to work or spend a little more time in preparation.\r\n\r\nCan you formula feed during the day and breastfeed when you are at home?\r\n\r\nAbsolutely. It is best if baby can exclusively breastfeed for the first six months but formula feeding and breastfeeding is very possible. Ideally, you will want to have your milk supply established first. If you plan to use formula while you are at work and continue breastfeeding, you should aim for breastfeeding exclusively for at least the first twelve weeks. After twelve weeks, your supply should be well established. You will still want to nurse as frequently as you can when you are with baby and use breastfeeding-friendly bottles with slow flow nipples. The drawback of this approach is that your milk supply will be affected. You will not make as much breast milk as you would if you were not using formula. Baby may get more frustrated at the breast if your milk supply becomes very low so this is something you will want to factor into your decision.\r\n\r\nTips for your transition back to work\r\n\r\nAsk for at least twelve weeks of maternity leave. You may decide to go back to work at six weeks but this way if something happens and you need the time, you have it. Your employer will be pleasantly surprised if you return to work earlier than expected but would probably be frustrated or unprepared if you do not return when expected. Find a babysitter close to your work. With a caregiver near your place of work, you can stop by at your lunch break to nurse your baby or if you caregiver needs extra breast milk you can drop off extra milk for her. Return to work in the middle of the week. Starting on a Thursday or Friday will make things a little easier on you. Work part time if you can. You may want to work part time or see if you can work shorter shifts. If this is something you can afford to do for a while this may help. Working part time and breastfeeding may be easier for you and baby. Nurse baby more frequently in the evening. This will help make up for some of the time away from baby. Some babies will completely reverse their feeding schedule (called reverse cycling) so that they can breastfeed from mom instead of taking a bottle. Make sure to drink plenty of water while you are at work. Staying hydrated will help you to pump more milk. Have a support system. Working and pumping is a lot of work. Talk with other moms who have breastfed and worked or join your local La Leche League for support."

       "title":"Sore Nipples",
       "tipDescription":"Introduction \r\n\r\nThe best treatment of sore nipples is prevention. The best prevention is latching the baby on properly from the first day. \r\n\r\nSore nipples are usually due to one or both of two causes. Either the baby is not positioned and latched properly, or the baby is not suckling properly, or both. Incidentally, babies learn to suck properly by getting milk from the breast when they are latched on well. (They learn by doing).\r\n\r\nFungal infection (due to Candida albicans), may also cause sore nipples. The soreness caused by poor latching and ineffective suckle hurts most as you latch the baby on and usually improves as the baby nurses. The pain from the fungal infection goes on throughout the feed and may continue even after the feed is over. Women describe knifelike pain from the first two causes. The pain of the fungal infection is often described as burning, but may not have this character. Sudden, unexplained onset of nipple pain when feedings had previously been painless is a tipoff that the pain may be due to a yeast infection, but the pain may come on gradually or may be superimposed on pain due to other causes. Cracks may be due to a yeast infection. \r\n\r\nProper Positioning and Latching \r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon for women to experience difficulty positioning and latching the baby on. Proper positioning facilitates a good latch and good latching reduces the baby's chances of becoming \"gassy\", and also allows the baby to control the flow of milk. Thus, poor latching may also result in the baby not gaining adequately, or feeding frequently, or being colicky (handout #2 Colic in the Breastfed Baby). \r\n\r\nPositioning - For the purposes of explanation, let us assume that you are feeding on the left breast. \r\n\r\nGood positioning facilitates a good latch. A lot of what follows under latching comes automatically if the baby is well positioned in the first place. \r\n\r\nAt first, it may be easiest to use the cross cradle hold to position your baby for latching on. Hold the baby in your right arm, the web between your thumb and index finger behind the nape of his neck (not behind his head) with your fingers (except for the thumb) supporting the baby's face from underneath, and your forearm supporting his back and buttocks. Hold the baby's buttocks between your chest and your forearm-this should give you good control. The baby should be almost horizontal across your body and should be turned so that his chest, belly and thighs are against you with a slight tilt so the baby can look at you. Hold the breast with your left hand, with the thumb on top and the other fingers underneath, fairly far back from the nipple and areola. \r\n\r\nThe baby should be approaching the breast with the head just slightly tilted backwards. The nipple then automatically points to the roof of the baby's mouth. (See handout on positioning and latching on) \r\n\r\nLatching \r\n\r\nNow, get the baby to open up his mouth wide. The way to do this is to run your nipple, still pointing to the roof of the baby's mouth, along the baby's mouth, very lightly, from one corner of the mouth to the other. Or you can run the baby along your nipple, something some mothers find easier. Wait for the baby to open up as if yawning. WAIT FOR HIM. As you bring the baby toward the breast, his chin should touch your breast first. \r\n\r\nWhen the baby opens up his mouth, use the arm that is holding him to bring him onto the breast. Don't worry about the baby's breathing. If he is properly positioned and latched on, he will breathe without any problem. If he cannot breathe, he will pull away from the breast. Don't be afraid to be vigorous. \r\n\r\nIf the nipple still hurts, use your index finger to pull down on the baby's chin in order to bring the lower lip out. You may have to do this for the duration of the feed, but this is usually not necessary. \r\n\r\nThe same principles apply whether you are sitting or lying down with the baby or using the football hold. Get the baby to open wide, don't let the baby latch onto the nipple, but get as much of the areola (brown part of breast) into the mouth as possible (not necessarily the whole areola). \r\n\r\nThere is no \"normal\" length of feeding time. If you have questions, call the clinic. A baby properly latched on will be covering more of the areola with his lower lip than with the upper lip. \r\n\r\nImproving the baby's suckle \r\n\r\nThe baby learns to suckle properly by nursing and by getting milk into his mouth. The baby's suckle may be made ineffective or not appropriate for breastfeeding by the early use of artificial nipples or from poor latching on from the beginning. Some babies just seem to take their time developing an effective suckle. Suck training and\/or finger feeding (handout #8 Finger Feeding) may help. \r\n\r\n\"My nipple turns white after the baby comes off the breast\" \r\n\r\nThe pain associated with this blanching of the nipple is frequently described by mothers as \"burning\", but generally begins only after the feeding is over. It may last several minutes or more, after which the nipple returns to its normal colour, but then a new pain develops which is usually described by mothers as \"throbbing\". The throbbing part of the pain may last for seconds or minutes and may even blanch again. The cause would seem to be a spasm of the blood vessels in the nipple (when the nipple is white), followed by relaxation of these blood vessels (when the nipple returns to its normal colour). Sometimes this pain continues even after the nipple pain during the feeding no longer is a problem, so that the mother has pain only after the feeding, but not during it. What can be done? \r\n\r\nPay careful attention to getting the baby to latch onto the breast properly. This type of pain is almost always associated with, and probably caused by whatever is causing your pain during the feeding. The best treatment is the treatment of the other causes of nipple pain. \r\n\r\nHeat (hot washcloth, hot water bottle, hair dryer) applied to the nipple immediately after nursing may prevent or decrease the reaction. Dry heat is usually better than wet heat, because wet heat may cause further damage to the nipples. \r\n\r\nOn occasion, we have had to use a medicated paste (nitroglycerine) or an oral medication (nifedipine) to prevent this type of reaction. \r\n\r\nGeneral Measures \r\n\r\nNipples can be warmed for short periods of time after each feeding, using a hair dryer on low setting. Nipples should be exposed to air as much as possible. When it is not possible to expose nipples to air, plastic dome-shaped breast shells (not nipple shields) can be worn to protect your nipples from rubbing by your clothing. Nursing pads keep moisture against the nipple and may cause damage that way. They also tend to stick to damaged nipples. If you leak a lot you can wear the pad over the breast shell. Ointments can sometimes be helpful. If you do use an ointment, use just a very small amount after nursing and do not wash it off. Do not wash your nipples frequently. Daily bathing is more than enough. Using a Lactation Aid) can be used to supplement (preferably expressed milk), so that the baby will finish the feeding on the first side. \r\n\r\n\r\nNipples shields are not recommended for sore nipples, because, although they may help temporarily, they usually do not. They may also cut down the milk supply dramatically, and the baby may become fussy and not gain weight well. Once the baby is used to them, it may be impossible to get the baby back onto the breast. In fact, many women who have tried nipple shields find that they do not help with soreness. Use as a last resort only, but get help first. \r\n\r\nHandout #3 Sore nipples.

       "title":"Colic in the Breastfed Baby",
       "tipDescription":"Colic is one of the mysteries of nature. Nobody knows what it really is, but everyone has an opinion. In the typical situation, the baby starts to have crying periods about two to three weeks after birth. These occur mainly in the evening, and finally stop when the baby is about 3 months of age (occasionally older ). When the baby cries, he is often inconsolable, though if he is walked, rocked or taken for a drive, he may settle temporarily. For a baby to be called colicky, it is necessary that he be gaining weight well and be otherwise healthy.\r\n\r\nThe notion of colic has been extended to include almost any fussiness or crying in the baby, and this may be valid, since we do not really know what colic is. There is no treatment for colic, though many medications and behaviour strategies have been tried, without any proved benefit. It is admitted that everyone knows someone whose baby was cured of colic by a particular treatment. It is also admitted that almost every treatment seems to work-for a short time, anyhow.\r\n\r\nThe Breastfeeding Baby with Colic\r\n\r\nAside from the colic that any baby may have, there are three known situations in the breastfed baby which may result in fussiness or colic. Once again, it is assumed that the baby is gaining adequately and that the baby is healthy.\r\n\r\nFeeding Both Breasts at Each Feeding\r\n\r\nHuman milk changes during a feeding. One of the ways in which it changes is that the amount of fat increases as the baby nurses longer at the breast. If the mother automatically switches the baby from one breast to the other during the feed, before the baby has \"finished\" the first side, the baby may get a relatively low amount of fat during the feeding. This may result in the baby getting fewer calories, and thus feeding more frequently. If the baby takes in a lot of milk (to make up for the reduced concentration of calories), he may spit up. Because of the relatively low fat content of the milk, the stomach empties quickly, and a large load of milk sugar (lactose) arrives in the intestine all at once. The protein which digests the sugar (lactase) may not be able to handle so much milk sugar at one time and the baby will have the symptoms of lactose intolerance--crying, gas, and explosive, watery, greenish bowel movements. This may occur even during the feeding. These babies are not lactose intolerant. They have problems with lactose because of the sort of information women get about breastfeeding. This is not a reason to switch to lactose free formula.\r\n\r\nDo not time feedings.\r\n\r\nMothers all over the world have breastfed babies successfully without being able to tell time. Breastfeeding problems are greatest in societies where everyone has a watch and least where no one has a watch. The mother should feed the baby on one breast, as long as the baby breastfeeds, until the baby comes off himself, or is asleep at the breast. If the baby feeds for only a short time only, the mother can compress the breast (handout #15 Breast Compression) to keep the baby nursing. Please note that a baby may be on the breast for two hours, but may actually feed for only a few minutes. In that case the milk taken by the baby may still be relatively low in fat. This is the rationale for compressing the breast. If, after \"finishing\" on the first side, the baby still wants to feed, offer the other side. The next feeding, the mother should start the baby on the other breast in the same way. The mother's body will adjust quickly to the new method, and she will not become engorged or lop sided. Just as there should be no \"rule\" for feeding both breasts at each feeding, there should be no rule for one breast per feeding. Let the baby finish on one breast (compress milk into his mouth if necessary to keep him swallowing longer) but if he wants more, then offer the other side.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, it may be helpful to feed the baby two or more feedings on one side before switching over to the other side for two or more feedings.\r\n\r\nThis problem is made worse if the baby is not well latched on to the breast. A proper latch is the key to easy breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nOveractive Letdown Reflex\r\n\r\nA baby who gets too much milk too quickly, may become very fussy, very irritable at the breast and may be considered \"colicky\". Typically, the baby is gaining very well. Typically, also, the baby starts nursing, and after a few seconds or minutes, starts to cough, choke or struggle at the breast. He may come off, and often, the mother's milk will spray. After this, the baby frequently returns to the breast, but may be fussy and repeat the performance. He may be unhappy with the rapid flow, and impatient when the flow slows. This can be a very trying time for everyone. On rare occasions, a baby may even start refusing to take the breast after several weeks, typically around three months of age.\r\n\r\nWhat can be done?\r\n\r\nIf you have not already done so, try feeding the baby one breast\/feed. In some situations, feeding even two or three feedings on one breast before changing to the other breast may be helpful. If you experience engorgement on the unused breast, express just enough to feel comfortable.\r\n\r\nFeed the baby before he is ravenous. Do not hold off the feeding by giving water (a breastfeeding baby does not need water even in very hot weather) or a pacifier. A ravenous baby will \"attack\" the breast and cause a very active letdown reflex. Feed the baby as soon as he shows any sign of hunger. If he is still half asleep, all the better.\r\n\r\nFeed the baby in a calm, relaxed atmosphere, if possible. Loud music, bright lights and lots of action are not conducive to a successful feeding.\r\n\r\nLying down to nurse sometimes works very well. If lying sideways to feed does not help, try lying flat on your back with the baby lying on top of you to nurse. Gravity helps decrease the flow rate.\r\n\r\nIf you have time, express some milk (an ounce or so) before you feed the baby.\r\n\r\nThe baby may dislike the rapid flow, but also become fussy when the flow slows too much. If you think the baby is fussy because the flow is too slow, it will help to compress the breast to keep up the flow (handout #15 Breast Compression).\r\n\r\nThis problem is made worse if the baby is not well latched on to the breast. A good latch is the key to easy breastfeeding. On occasion giving the baby commercial lactase (the enzyme that metabolizes lactose), 2-4 drops before each feeding, relieves the symptoms. It is available without prescription, but fairly expensive, and works only occasionally.\r\n\r\nA nipple shield may help, but use this only if nothing else has helped and only if you have gotten good help without any relief. As a last resort, rather than switching to formula, give the baby your expressed milk by bottle.\r\n\r\nForeign Proteins in the mother's milk\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that some proteins present in the mother's diet may be excreted into her milk and may affect the baby. It would seem that the most common of these is cow's milk protein. Other proteins have also been shown to be excreted into some mothers' milk. The fact that these proteins and other substances appear in the mother's milk is not necessarily a bad thing. Indeed, it should be considered a good thing. Ask about this if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nThus, in the treatment of the colicky breastfed baby, one step would be for the mother to stop taking dairy products. These includes milk, cheese, yogurt, ice cream and anything else which may contain milk. When the milk protein has been changed (denatured), as in cooking for example, there should be no problem. Ask if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nPlease note: Intolerance to milk protein has nothing to do with lactose intolerance. A mother who is herself lactose intolerant should also still breastfeed her baby.\r\n\r\nSuggested Method:\r\n\r\nThe mother should eliminate all milk products for 7-10 days.\r\n\r\nIf there has been no change, the mother can reintroduce milk products.\r\n\r\nIf there has been a change for the better, the mother should then slowly reintroduce milk products into her diet, if these are normally part of her diet. (There is no need to drink milk in order to make milk). Some babies tolerate absolutely no milk products in the mother's diet. Most tolerate some. The mother will learn what amount of dairy products she can take without the baby reacting.\r\n\r\nIf there is concern about your calcium intake, calcium can be had without taking dairy products. Ask if you have any questions. One week off milk products will not cause any problems. Actually, evidence suggests that breastfeeding may protect the woman against the development of osteoporosis even if she does not take extra calcium. And the baby will get all he needs.\r\n\r\nThe mother should be careful about eliminating too many things from her diet. Everyone will know someone whose baby got better when the mother stopped broccoli, beef, bananas, bread etc. The mother may find that she is eating white rice only. Our diets are too complex to be sure exactly what, if anything, is affecting the baby.\r\n\r\nBe patient, the problem usually gets better no matter what. Formula is not the answer, though, because of the more regular flow, some babies do improve on it. But formula is not breastmilk. In fact, the baby would also improve on breastmilk from the bottle because of the regularity of the flow. Even if nothing works, time usually helps. The days and nights may seem eternal, but the weeks will fly by.\r\n\r\nHandout #2 Colic in the breastfed baby.

       "title":"Is My Baby Getting Enough Milk?",
       "tipDescription":"Breastfeeding mothers frequently ask how to know their babies are getting enough milk. The breast is not the bottle, and it is not possible to hold the breast up to the light to see how many ounces or millilitres of milk the baby drank. Our number obsessed society makes it difficult for some mothers to accept not seeing exactly how much milk the baby receives. However, there are ways of knowing that the baby is getting enough. In the long run, weight gain is the best indication whether the baby is getting enough, but rules about weight gain appropriate for bottle fed babies may not be appropriate for breastfed babies. \r\n\r\nWays of Knowing\r\n\r\nBaby's nursing is characteristic. \r\n\r\nA baby who is obtaining lots of milk at the breast sucks in a very characteristic way. The baby generally opens his mouth fairly wide as he sucks and the rhythm is slow and steady. His lips are turned out. At the maximum opening of his mouth, there is a perceptible pause which you can see if you watch his chin. Then, the baby closes his mouth again. This pause does not refer to the pause between suckles, but rather to the pause during one suckle as the baby opens his mouth to its maximum. Each one of these pauses corresponds to a mouthful of milk and the longer the pause, the more milk the baby got. At times, the baby can even be heard to be swallowing, and this is perhaps reassuring, but the baby can be getting lots of milk without making noise. Usually, the baby's suckle will change during the feeding, so that the above type of suck will alternate with sucks that could be described as \"nibbling\". This is normal. The baby who suckles as described above, with several minutes of pausing type sucks at each feeding, and then comes off the breast satisfied, is getting enough. The baby who nibbles only, or has the drinking type of suckle for a short period of time only, is probably not. This is the best way of knowing the baby is getting enough. This type of suckling can be seen on the very first day of life, though it is not as obvious as later when the mother has lots more milk. \r\n\r\nBaby's bowel movements. \r\n\r\nFor the first few days after delivery, the baby passes meconium, a dark green, almost black, substance. Meconium accumulates in the baby's gut during pregnancy. Meconium is passed during the first few days, and by the 3rd day, the bowel movements start becoming lighter, as more breastmilk is taken. Usually by the fifth day, the bowel movements have taken on the appearance of the normal breastmilk stool. The normal breastmilk stool is pasty to watery, mustard coloured, and usually has little odour. However, bowel movements may vary considerably from this description. They may be green or orange, may contain curds or mucus, or may resemble shaving lotion in consistency (from air bubbles). The variation in colour does not mean something is wrong. A baby who is breastfeeding only, and is starting to have bowel movements which are becoming lighter by day 3 of life, is doing well. \r\n\r\nWithout your becoming obsessive about it, monitoring the frequency and quantity of bowel motions is one of the best ways of knowing if the baby is getting enough milk. After the first 3-4 days, the baby should have increasing bowel movements so that by the end of the first week he should be passing at least 2-3 substantial yellow stools each day. In addition, many infants have a stained diaper with almost each feeding. A baby who is still passing meconium on the fifth day should be seen at the clinic the same day. A baby who is passing only brown bowel movements is probably not getting enough, but this is not yet definite. \r\n\r\nSome breastfed babies, after the first 3-4 weeks of life, may suddenly change their stool pattern from many each day, to one every 3 days or even less. Some babies have gone as long as 15 days or more without a bowel movement. As long as the baby is otherwise well, and the stool is the usual pasty or soft, yellow movement, this is not constipation and is of no concern. \r\n\r\nNo treatment is necessary or desirable\r\n\r\n, because no treatment is necessary or desirable for something that is normal. \r\n\r\nAny baby between 5 and 21 days of age who does not pass at least one substantial bowel movement within a 24 hour period should be seen at the breastfeeding clinic the same day. Generally, small infrequent bowel movements during this time period means insufficient intake. There are definite exceptions and everything may be fine, but it is better to check. \r\n\r\nUrination. \r\n\r\nWith six soaking wet (not just wet) diapers in a 24 hours hour period, after about 4-5 days of life, you can be sure that the baby is getting a lot of milk. Unfortunately, the new super dry \"disposable\" diapers often do indeed feel dry even when full of urine, but when soaked with urine they are heavy. It should be obvious that this indication of milk intake does not apply if you are giving the baby extra water (which, in any case, is unnecessary for breastfed babies, and if given by bottle, may interfere with breastfeeding). The baby's urine should be clear as water after the first few days, though an occasional darker urine is not of concern. \r\n\r\nUsing a Lactation Aid). Limiting the duration or frequency of feedings can also contribute to decreased intake of milk. \r\n\r\nThe following are NOT good ways of judging: \r\n\r\nYour breasts do not feel full.\r\n\r\nAfter the first few days or weeks, it is usual for most mothers not to feel full. Your body adjusts to your baby's requirements. This change may occur quite suddenly. Some mothers breastfeeding perfectly well never feel engorged or full. \r\n\r\nThe baby sleeps through the night.\r\n\r\nNot necessarily. A baby who is sleeping through the night at 10 days of age, for example, may, in fact, not be getting enough milk. A baby who is too sleepy and has to be awakened for feeds or who is \"too good\" may not be getting enough milk. There are many exceptions, but get help quickly. \r\n\r\nThe baby cries after feeding.\r\n\r\nAlthough the baby may cry after feeding because of hunger, there are also many other reasons for crying. See also handout #2 Colic in the Breastfeeding Baby. Do not limit feeding times. \r\n\r\nThe baby feeds often and\/or for a long time.\r\n\r\nFor one mother every 3 hours or so feedings may be often; for another, 3 hours or so may be a long period between feeds. For one a feeding that lasts for 30 minutes is a long feeding; for another it is a short one. There are no rules how often or for how long a baby should nurse. It is not true that the baby gets 90% of the feed in the first 10 minutes. Let the baby determine his own feeding schedule and things usually come right, if the baby is suckling and drinking at the breast and having at least 2-3 substantial yellow bowel movements each day. If that is the case, feeding on one breast each feeding (or at least finishing on one breast before switching over) will often lengthen the time between feedings. Remember, a baby may be on the breast for 2 hours, but if he is actually breastfeeding (open-pause-close type of sucking) for only 2 minutes, he will come off the breast hungry. If the baby falls asleep quickly at the breast, you can compress the breast to continue the flow of milk (handout #15 Breast Compression). Contact the breastfeeding clinic with any concerns, but wait to start supplementing. If supplementation is truly necessary, there are ways of supplementing which do not use an artificial nipple (handout #5 Using a Lactation Aid). \r\n\r\n\"I can express only half an ounce of milk\".\r\n\r\nThis means nothing and should not influence you. Therefore, you should not pump your breasts \"just to know\". Most mothers have plenty of milk. The problem usually is that the baby is not getting the milk that is there, either because he is latched on poorly, or the suckle is ineffective or both. These problems can often be fixed easily. \r\n\r\nThe baby will take a bottle after feeding.\r\n\r\nThis does not necessarily mean that the baby is still hungry. This is not a good test, as bottles may interfere with breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nThe 5 week old is suddenly pulling away from the breast but still seems hungry.\r\n\r\nThis does not mean your milk has \"dried up\" or decreased. During the first few weeks of life, babies often fall asleep at the breast when the flow of milk slows down even if they have not had their fill. When they are older (4-6 weeks of age), they no longer are content to fall asleep, but rather start to pull away or get upset. The milk supply has not changed; the baby has. Compress the breast (handout #15 Breast Compression) to increase flow. \r\n\r\nPlease Note: On occasion, it may be necessary to supplement a baby who is breastfeeding. If this is done by bottle, a bad situation may become worse. A lactation aid is a method of supplementing without giving a bottle and may allow you to supplement temporarily and get back to exclusive breastfeeding. It is generally easy to use. In an \"emergency\" situation, extra fluid can be given by spoon, cup or eyedropper until a lactation aid can be started. \r\n\r\nNotes on scales and weights\r\n\r\nScales are all different. We have documented significant differences from one scale to another. Weights have often been written down wrong. A soaked cloth diaper may weigh several hundred grams (half a pound or more), so babies should be weighed naked. Many rules about weight gain are taken from observations of growth of formula feeding babies. They do not necessarily apply to breastfeeding babies. A slow start may be compensated for later, by fixing the breastfeeding. Growth charts are guidelines only. \r\n\r\nHandout #4.\r\n\r\nIs My Baby Getting Enough?\r\n\r\nRevised January 1998 \r\n\r\nJack Newman, MD, FRCPC is a pediatrician, a graduate of the University of Toronto medical school.

       "title":"Still More Breastfeeding Myths",
       "tipDescription":"1. Women with flat or inverted nipples cannot breastfeed. \r\n\r\nNot true! Babies do not breastfeed on nipples, they breastfeed on the breast. Though it may be easier for a baby to latch on to a breast with a prominent nipple, it is not necessary for nipples to stick out. A proper start will usually prevent problems and mothers with any shaped nipples can breastfeed perfectly adequately. In the past, a nipple shield was frequently suggested to get the baby to take the breast.\r\n\r\nThis gadget should not be used, especially in the first few days! Though it may seem a solution, its use often result in poor feeding and severe weight loss, and makes it even more difficult to get the baby to take the breast. (Handout #8 Finger Feeding). If the baby does not take the breast at first, with proper help, he will often take the breast later. Breasts also change in the first few weeks, and as long as the mother maintains a good milk supply, the baby will usually latch on, sooner or later. \r\n\r\n2. A woman who becomes pregnant must stop breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nNot true! If the mother and child desire, breastfeeding can continue. There are women who continue nursing the older child even after delivery of the new baby. Many women do decide to stop nursing when they become pregnant because their nipples are sore, or for other reasons, but there is no rush nor medical necessity to do so. In fact, there are often good reasons to continue. The milk supply may decrease during pregnancy, but if the baby is taking other foods, this is not a problem. \r\n\r\n3. A baby with diarrhea should not breastfeed. \r\n\r\nNot true! The best treatment for a gut infection (gastroenteritis) is breastfeeding. Furthermore, it is very unusual for the baby to require fluids other than breastmilk. If lactose intolerance is a problem, the baby can receive lactase drops, available without prescription, just before or after the feeding, but this is rarely necessary in breastfeeding babies. Get information on its use from the clinic. In any case, lactose intolerance due to gastroenteritis will disappear with time. Lactose free formula is not better than breastfeeding. Breastfeeding is better than any formula. \r\n\r\n4. Babies will stay on the breast for 2 hours because they like to suck. \r\n\r\nNot true! Babies need and like to suck, but how much do they need? Most babies who stay at the breast for such a long time are probably hungry, even though they may be gaining well. Being at the breast is not the same as drinking at the breast. Latching the baby better onto the breast allows the baby to nurse more effectively, and thus spend more time actually drinking. You can also help the baby to drink more by expressing milk into his mouth when he is no longer swallows on his own (Handout #15 Breast Compression). Babies younger than 5-6 weeks often fall asleep at the breast because the flow of milk is slow, not necessarily because they have had enough to eat. \r\n\r\n5. Babies need to know how to take a bottle. Therefore a bottle should always be introduced before the baby refuses to take one. \r\n\r\nNot true! Though many mothers decide to introduce a bottle for various reasons, there is no reason a baby must learn how to use one. Indeed, there is no great advantage in a baby's taking a bottle. Since Canadian women are supposed to receive 26 weeks maternity leave, the baby can be started eating solids before the mother goes back to her outside work. The baby can even take fluids or solids that are quite liquidy off a spoon. At about 6 months of age, the baby can start learning how to drink from a cup, and though it may take several weeks for him to learn to use it efficiently, he will learn. If the mother is going to introduce a bottle, it is better she wait until the baby has been nursing well for 4-6 weeks, and then give it only occasionally. Sometimes, however, babies who take the bottle well at 6 weeks, refuse it at 3 or 4 months even if they have been getting bottles regularly (smart babies). Do not worry, and proceed as above with solids and spoon. Giving a bottle when breastfeeding is going badly is not a good idea and usually makes the breastfeeding even more difficult. For your sake and the baby's do not try to \"starve the baby into submission\". Get help. \r\n\r\n6. If a mother has surgery, she has to wait a day before restarting nursing. \r\n\r\nNot true! The mother can breastfeed immediately after surgery, as soon as she is up to it. Neither the medications used during anaesthesia, nor pain medications nor antibiotics used after surgery require the mother to avoid breastfeeding, except under exceptional circumstances. Enlightened hospitals will accommodate breastfeeding mothers and babies when either the mother or the baby needs to be admitted to the hospital, so that breastfeeding can continue. Many rules that restrict breastfeeding are more for the convenience of staff than for the benefit of mothers and babies. \r\n\r\n7. Breastfeeding twins is too difficult to manage. \r\n\r\nNot true! Breastfeeding twins is easier than bottle feeding twins, if breastfeeding is going well. This is why it is so important that a special effort should be made to get breastfeeding started right when the mother has had twins (Handout #1 Breastfeeding-Starting Out Right). Many women have breastfed triplets exclusively. This obviously takes a lot of work and time, but twins and triplets take a lot of work and time no matter how the infants are fed. \r\n\r\n8. Women whose breasts do not enlarge or enlarge only a little during pregnancy, will not produce enough milk. \r\n\r\nNot true! There are a very few women who cannot produce enough milk (though they can continue to breastfeed by supplementing with a lactation aid). Some of these women say that their breasts did not enlarge during pregnancy. However, the vast majority of women whose breasts do not seem to enlarge during pregnancy produce more than enough milk. \r\n\r\n9. A mother whose breasts do not seem full has little milk in the breast. \r\n\r\nNot true! Breasts do not have to feel full to produce plenty of milk. It is normal that a breastfeeding woman's breasts feel less full as her body adjusts to her baby's milk intake. This can happen suddenly and may occur as early as two weeks after birth or even earlier. The breast is never \"empty\" and also produces milk as the baby nurses. \r\n\r\n10. Breastfeeding in public is not decent. \r\n\r\nNot true! It is the humiliation and harassment of mothers who are nursing their babies that is not decent. Women who are trying to do the best for their babies should not be forced by other people's lack of understanding to stay home or feed their babies in public washrooms. Those who are offended need only avert their eyes. Children will not be damaged psychologically by seeing a women breastfeeding. On the contrary, they might learn something important, beautiful and fascinating. They might even learn that breasts are not only for selling beer. Other women who have left their babies at home to be bottle fed when they went out might be encouraged to bring the baby with them the next time. \r\n\r\n11. Breastfeeding a child until 3 or 4 years of age is abnormal and bad for the child, causing an overdependent relationship between mother and child. \r\n\r\nNot true! Breastfeeding for 2-4 years was the rule in most cultures since the beginning of human time on this planet. Only in the last 100 years or so has breastfeeding been seen as something to be limited. Children nursed into the third year are not overly dependent. On the contrary, they tend to be very secure and thus more independent. They themselves will make the step to stop breastfeeding (with gentle encouragement from the mother), and thus will be secure in their accomplishment. \r\n\r\n12. If the baby is off the breast for a few days (weeks), the mother should not restart breastfeeding because the milk sours. \r\n\r\nNot true! The milk is as good as it ever was. Breastmilk in the breast is not milk or formula in a bottle. \r\n\r\n13. After exercise a mother should not breastfeed. \r\n\r\nNot true! There is absolutely no reason why a mother would not be able to breastfeed after exercising. The study that purported to show that babies were fussy feeding after mother exercising was poorly done and contradicts the everyday experience of millions of mothers. \r\n\r\n14. A breastfeeding mother cannot get a permanent or dye her hair. \r\n\r\nNot true! \r\n\r\n15. Breastfeeding is blamed for everything. \r\n\r\nTrue! Family, health professionals, neighbours, friends and taxi drivers will blame breastfeeding if the mother is tired, nervous, weepy, sick, has pain in her knees, has difficulty sleeping, is always sleepy, feels dizzy, is anemic, has a relapse of her arthritis (migraines, or any chronic problem) complains of hair loss, change of vision, ringing in the ears or itchy skin. Breastfeeding will be blamed as the cause of marriage problems and the other children acting up. Breastfeeding is to blame when the mortgage rates go up and the economy is faltering. And whenever there is something that does not fit the \"picture book\" life, the mother will be advised by everyone that it will be better if she stops breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nHandout #13.

       "title":"Latch on Techniques for Breastfeeding",
       "tipDescription":"If you are a mom that is struggling to get your baby to latch on, you may be feeling frustrated, emotional, and defeated. Breastfeeding is supposed to be a natural process and yet your baby just can’t get it figured out. When you look for advice, you may find that the instructions for latching on are so complicated and contain so many details that you just can’t keep it all straight. Moreover, the information you may have been given on how to latch, even from the professionals, may not be working for you. If you’ve tried getting your baby to latch and she just won’t do it, we are here to help with easy advice on how to get your baby to latch. Take a deep breath and read on.\r\n\r\nBefore you sit down to nurse\r\n\r\nWatch for hunger cues: Before you try to sit down and nurse your baby, it’s important to make sure you are relaxed and that your baby is not too hungry and frustrated. Watch her for hunger cues. When she’s starting to get hungry, she may suck on her fingers or hands, smack or lick her lips, root around, squirm, or fuss. If she starts frantically sucking on her fingers or crying, these are later hunger cues. If you wait until she’s very hungry and frustrated, latching on will be more difficult, especially if she’s already gotten accustomed to the instant gratification that goes along with bottle feeding. Try to offer her the breast when she first shows signs of being hungry.\r\n\r\nPick a comfortable position: Find a position that is comfortable for you. You may want to use a nursing pillow to help you get comfortable. One of the easiest positions for beginners is the cradle hold. If you are using a nursing pillow, you may find a variation of the cradle hold called the cross-cradle hold, works best. See LLLI’s How do I position my baby to breastfeed?\r\n\r\nOnce you’re comfortable you can try latching on. Here are a few of the most common techniques for latching on. You may want to try more than one method to see which feels right and works best for you.\r\n\r\nMost common techniques for latching on\r\n\r\nBulls-eye latch: This is one of the oldest methods for latching on. This is most likely the technique you were taught in the hospital. This technique works best with the cradle hold. With this method, you hold your breast with your free hand and tickle your baby’s lip with your nipple. When your baby feels your nipple on her mouth, she will open up her mouth instinctively. Wait until she opens her mouth wide and then attempt latching on. \r\n\r\nWhen her mouth is opened wide, position your nipple towards the center of her mouth and quickly pull her in towards you using the arm that is supporting her head. You want to get as much of the areola into her mouth as possible. Make sure she gets plenty of areola in her mouth. She will not be able to remove as much milk from your breast if she is only sucking on the nipple. And, this type of shallow latch often results in nipple soreness.\r\n\r\nHelpful link: \r\nProper Positioning and Latch-on Skills\r\n\r\nAsymmetric latch: The asymmetric latch is similar to the bulls-eye latch, but instead of trying to get baby centered onto the nipple, baby is latched slightly off-centered. With this method baby gets more breast tissue close to her lower jaw and tongue. If you look at the diagram you will see that instead of getting some areola tissue above the nipple and some areola tissue below the nipple, she is getting a lot more of the breast tissue below the nipple in contact with her lower jaw. By having more tissue contacting your baby’s tongue and lower jaw, baby is better able to remove milk. This latch may also feel more comfortable for mom.\r\n\r\nIt’s easiest to use the cross-cradle hold when using the asymmetric latch. Tickle your baby’s lip with your nipple, like you would with the bulls-eye latch, and wait for her to open wide. When she opens wide, aim her mouth just below your nipple, so that her lower lip and chin are lined up a little below your nipple. Your goal is for her to connect with your areola first and then the nipple. When she gets the areola into her mouth, quickly bring her mouth over the nipple so that she has both the areola and the nipple in her mouth. \r\n\r\nHelpful links: \r\nAsymmetric latch instructions and pictures\r\nAsymmetrical latch photo tutorial\r\nAsymmetric latch videos\r\n\r\nNipple Sandwich technique: To help your baby get more of the breast tissue into her mouth you can try the nipple sandwich technique. When your baby tries to latch onto your breast, she may have a hard time getting enough tissue in her mouth. If you think of your breast like a thick submarine sandwich, it’s easy to understand why. When you hold onto a sandwich to take a bite, what do you do? You squish it so the bread fits into your mouth. You don’t just try to bite into it. This is the rationale of the nipple sandwich technique. Think about the position of your baby’s mouth when she “takes a bite” of the nipple sandwich. You want your breast to be compressed (vertically if she’s lying across your lap or horizontally if you’re using the football hold) so that when she latches on, she doesn’t have to work so hard to get it all in her mouth.\r\n\r\nHelpful links: \r\nPositioning and nipple sandwich technique with pictures\r\nNipple Sandwich with a twist\r\nDeep latch technique\r\n\r\nFlipple technique: If you have a hard time getting your baby to open her mouth wide or just can’t get your nipple into her mouth using the traditional techniques, you may want to try the flipple technique. It’s a variation of the asymmetric latch. Here’s how you do it. First place your finger above your nipple and press into your breast. This will flip your nipple upward. Then position your baby below your nipple. As soon as she opens her mouth wide, use your finger to flip the nipple into her mouth. Once she is latched on, remove your finger.\r\n\r\nHelpful links:\r\nFlipple technique\r\nFlipple technique video\r\nNipple twist latch (a variation of the flipple technique)\r\n\r\nMore latching technique links:\r\nThe Mother-Baby Dance: Positioning and Latch-On \r\n\r\nBaby led latch: If you are trying to get baby to latch on and are having a difficult time with all of the techniques, you may want to read more about the concept of baby-led latching. Pediatrician Christina Smillie discussed this idea with Today’s Parent magazine. Dr. Smillie believes that babies were born with instincts that guide them on how to find their mother’s nipple and latch on. Sometimes by trying to get your baby to latch a certain way, you can get in her way and keep her from figuring things out all on her own.\r\n\r\nTo try baby led latching, just relax and cuddle with your baby skin to skin. Sit in a comfortable chair with baby in an upright position. Let baby naturally find her way to your breast when she gets hungry. You can help baby to get closer to your breast, but try to let baby make the moves. When she gets close to your breast and starts rooting, let her find your nipple and latch on. \r\n\r\nHelpful links:\r\nBaby led latching \r\nBaby led latching with pictures\r\n\r\nHow can you tell if your baby is latched on correctly?\r\n\r\nHere are a few signs of a good latch:\r\n\r\nYou should not have pain. You may feel some discomfort when baby first latches on, however. This should only last for a few second and should go away once your baby has been breastfeeding for a week or so. If you have pain or nipple soreness, this is likely due to incorrect latching and positioning.Your baby’s lips should be flanged (or turned outward like a fish). Your baby should have at least 1 inch of your areola in her mouth. You should see baby’s ears wiggle when he swallows. You should hear baby swallowing. You should see and feel a good seal. Milk shouldn’t leak out the sides if your baby is latched on well. \r\n\r\nIf you are still having problems with latching on:\r\n\r\nIf you have tried all of the techniques listed and are still having problems, either with refusal to latch or painful latch, you may need to work with a lactation consultant. You can also get help from a breastfeeding peer counselor or the La Leche League. \r\n\r\nResources:\r\nLa Leche League \r\nNational Breastfeeding Helpline\r\nFind a Lactation Consultant"

       "title":"One of the Five Percent Coping with Low Milk Supply",
       "tipDescription":"With tears in my eyes, I reluctantly gave my son his first bottle of formula. I sat there asking myself why I was crying. It wasn't guilt. I knew I had nothing to feel guilty about. My child was losing weight and my doctor and my lactation consultant both said it was necessary to supplement. It wasn't what other people thought. I was never one to care about what others thought. It wasn't failure. I knew I had done everything right. I was breastfeeding every one to three hours and he was latched correctly. From everything I knew about breastfeeding from all that I read and words of encouragement from breastfeeding friends, my child should be gaining weight and certainly not losing it.\r\n\r\nIt finally hit me as he sucked down the last drop of formula, it was loss that I was feeling. Grief over the loss of our exclusive breastfeeding relationship. It was also anger, frustration, and disappointment. I was angry with my body. Why had it let me down? I had something called insufficient milk syndrome. Something I had not read about in all my breastfeeding books. You see, I was one of the five percent.\r\n\r\nInsufficient milk syndrome is kind of a catch all word to cover people like me, who for one reason or another, do not produce enough breast milk to feed their babies. This is not written to be alarming or frightening to new breastfeeding mothers as this truly is a rare condition. Instead, this is written to share my personal struggles with breastfeeding and provide encouragement to mothers like me who find themselves in the approximate five percent of women who have problems with breastfeeding or milk supply issues.\r\n\r\nCauses of low milk supply\r\n\r\nhormonal conditions such as PCOS and untreated hypothyroidism breast hypoplasia or a history of breast reduction surgery cleft lip, cleft palate, or other issues that affect baby's ability to suck properly supplementing, nipple confusion, scheduled feedings, sore nipples, and other correctable breastfeeding problems \r\n\r\nThe majority of women with breastfeeding problems fall into the fourth cause listed for low milk supply. With the help of a lactation consultant these can be worked through and corrected to allow for a successful breastfeeding relationship.\r\n\r\nPCOS and breastfeeding\r\n\r\nPCOS, which stands for Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, is a condition that affects women's menstrual cycle, ovulation, hormones, and appearance. Studies have shown that women with PCOS are at greater risk for low milk supply. If you have been diagnosed with PCOS you could experience problems breastfeeding. That being said, the majority of women with PCOS can breastfeed and even those who do experience difficulties can usually breastfeed with supplementing of infant formula.\r\n\r\nThyroid disorders can be treated with medication thereby allowing for successful breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nBreast hypoplasia and breastfeeding\r\n\r\nBreast hypoplasia and breast reduction surgery can interfere with successful breastfeeding. It is often said size doesn't matter. Many flat chested women have been told not to worry that size is not an issue. Be assured this is completely true! However, shape does matter. For me, breast hypoplasia was the cause of our breastfeeding problems. I always knew my breasts were small and oddly shaped, but I did not know the name for it, nor that it could cause problems with breastfeeding. Breast hypoplasia should only be diagnosed by a doctor, midwife, lactation consultant, or other qualified health professional. In breast hypoplasia, there is very little glandular tissue. Breasts are narrow and tubular shaped, set far apart, and one breast is often quite larger than the other. The good news is that even with breast hypoplasia more than a third of women can still breastfeed without any problems. Medications such as Reglan and herbal supplements including fenugreek have been used to help with these type of supply issues.\r\n\r\nCleft lip and breastfeeding\r\n\r\nCleft lips and a high palate or other anatomical issues with baby that interfere with proper latching can affect a women's milk supply. Cleft lip occurs when the area between the mouth and the nose does not close properly during fetal development causing an opening in the upper lip. Likewise, a cleft palate is an opening in the palate between the mouth and the nose. Cleft lip may vary in appearance from a small notch to a complete opening into the nose.\r\n\r\nBabies with cleft lip usually can breastfeed even before corrective surgery without too much difficulty. Babies with cleft palate may be unable to breastfeed. Consult a lactation consultant for proper techniques and positioning for breastfeeding a baby with cleft lip or palate.\r\n\r\nAlong with the conditions discussed above, there are some medical conditions such as galactosemia that breastfeeding is contraindicated for. Women who are HIV positive should not breastfeed.\r\n\r\nIt is important to reemphasize that it is very unusual to have a true milk supply problem. It is not uncommon for women to have a perceived supply problem when in actuality baby is gaining weight and receiving plenty of nourishment from mom. If you think you have a milk supply problem, you should consult with a lactation consultant before giving up on breastfeeding. Lactation consultants have extensive training and can help tremendously in solving breastfeeding difficulties. Even if supplementing is necessary, they can work with you on the best ways for breastfeeding to work for you.\r\n\r\nDifficulty breastfeeding can take it's toll on a new mother. Feelings of depression or guilt are difficult to cope with. Here are our best tips for coping with a milk supply problem.\r\n\r\nSurround yourself with supportive family and friends. Allow yourself time to grieve. It is okay to be upset, angry, and disappointed. Talking about these feelings may help you work through them. Use a supplementer, such as Medela's SNS (supplemental nursing system), if possible. If baby is able to breastfeed, it will help you to continue the closeness desired from breastfeeding. Cuddle with your baby. Probably the most therapeutic thing you can do is spend plenty of time cuddling with your baby. Nothing can help more to than seeing a bright smile, coo, or grin to reassure confidence and help mend the wounds of a milk supply problem."

       "title":"Breastfeeding and Jaundice",
       "tipDescription":"Introduction \r\n\r\nJaundice is due to a buildup in the blood of bilirubin, a yellow pigment which comes from the breakdown of old red blood cells. It is normal for red blood cells to break down, but the bilirubin formed does not usually cause jaundice because the liver metabolizes it and gets rid of it into the gut. \r\n\r\nThe newborn baby, however, often becomes jaundiced during the first few days because the liver enzyme which metabolizes bilirubin is relatively immature. Furthermore, newborn babies have more red blood cells than adults, and thus more are breaking down at any one time. If the baby is premature, or stressed from a difficult birth, or the infant of a diabetic mother, or more than the usual number of red blood cells are breaking down (as happens in blood incompatibility), the level of bilirubin in the blood may rise higher than what is usual.\r\n\r\nTwo Types of Jaundice \r\n\r\nThe liver changes bilirubin so that it can be eliminated from the body. If, however, the liver is functioning poorly, as occurs during some infections, or the tubes which transport the bilirubin to the gut are blocked, this changed bilirubin may accumulate in the blood and also cause jaundice. When this occurs, the changed bilirubin (called conjugated bilirubin), appears in the urine and turns the urine brown. This brown urine is an important clue that the jaundice is not \"ordinary\". Jaundice due to conjugated bilirubin is always abnormal, frequently serious and needs to be investigated thoroughly and immediately. Except in the case of a few extremely rare metabolic diseases, breastfeeding can and should continue. \r\n\r\nAccumulation of bilirubin before it has been changed by the enzyme of the liver may be normal-\"physiologic jaundice\". Physiologic jaundice begins on the 2nd or 3rd day, peaks on the 3rd or 4th day and then begins to disappear. However, there may be other conditions which cause an exaggeration of this type of jaundice, such as a more rapid than normal breakdown of red blood cells. Because these conditions have no association with breastfeeding, breastfeeding should continue. If, for example, the baby has severe jaundice due to rapid breakdown of red blood cells, this is not a reason to take the baby off the breast. Breastfeeding should continue. \r\n\r\nBreastmilk Jaundice \r\n\r\nThere is a condition commonly called breastmilk jaundice. No one knows what the cause of breastmilk jaundice is. In order to make this diagnosis, the baby should be at least a week old, though interestingly, many of the babies with breastmilk jaundice also have had physiologic jaundice, sometimes to levels higher than usual. The baby should be gaining well, with breastfeeding alone, having lots of bowel movements, passing plentiful, clear urine and be generally well (handout #4 Is my baby getting enough milk?). In such a setting, the baby has what some call breastmilk jaundice, though, on occasion, infections of the urine or an under functioning of the baby's thyroid gland may cause the same picture. Breastmilk jaundice peaks at 10-21 days, but may last for 2-3 months. Breastmilk jaundice is normal. Rarely, if ever, does breastfeeding need to be discontinued even for a short time. There is not one bit of evidence that this jaundice causes any problem at all for the baby. Breastfeeding should not be discontinued \"in order to make a diagnosis\". If, however, your doctor feels that discontinuing breastfeeding is appropriate, it would be worth trying a lactation aid with formula (handout #5 Using a Lactation Device) rather than taking the baby off the breast altogether, since this may result in difficulties with breastfeeding afterwards. If the baby is truly doing well on breast only, there is no reason, none, to stop breastfeeding or supplement with a lactation aid, for that matter. The notion that there is something wrong with the baby being jaundiced comes from the assumption that the formula feeding baby is the standard by which we should determine how the breastfed baby should be. This manner of thinking, almost universal amongst health professionals, truly turns logic upside down. Thus, the formula feeding baby is rarely jaundiced after the first week of life, and when he is, there is usually something wrong. Therefore, the baby with breastmilk jaundice is a concern and \"something must be done\". However, in our experience, most exclusively breastfed babies who are perfectly healthy and gaining weight well are still jaundiced at 5-6 weeks of life and even later. The question, in fact, should be whether it is normal not to be jaundiced and is this absence of jaundice something we should worry about? Do not stop breastfeeding for jaundice. \r\n\r\nNot-enough-breastmilk Jaundice \r\n\r\nHigher than usual levels of bilirubin or longer than usual jaundice may occur because the baby is not getting enough milk. This may be due to the fact that the mother's milk takes a longer than average time to \"come in\", or because hospital routines limit breastfeeding or because, most importantly, the baby is poorly latched on and thus not getting the milk which is available (handout #4 Is my baby getting enough milk?). When the baby is getting little milk, bowel movements tend to be scanty and infrequent so that the bilirubin that was in the baby's gut gets reabsorbed into the blood instead of leaving the body with the bowel movements. Obviously, the best way to avoid \"not-enough-breastmilk jaundice\" is to get breastfeeding started properly (handout #1 Breastfeeding-Starting Out Right). However, the answer to not-enough-breastmilk jaundice, is not to take the baby off the breast or to give bottles. If the baby is nursing well, more frequent feedings may be enough to bring the bilirubin down more quickly, though, in fact, nothing needs be done. If the baby is nursing poorly, helping the baby latch on better may allow him to nurse more effectively and thus receive more milk. Compressing the breast to get more milk into the baby may help (handout #15 Breast Compression). If latching and breast compression alone do not work, a lactation aid would be appropriate to supplement feedings (handout #5 Using a Lactation Aid). \r\n\r\nPhototherapy (Bilirubin Lights) \r\n\r\nPhototherapy increases the fluid requirements of the baby. If the baby is nursing well, more frequent feeding can usually make up this increased requirement. However, if it is felt that the baby needs more fluids, use a lactation aid to supplement, preferably expressed breastmilk, expressed milk with sugar water or sugar water alone rather than formula. \r\n\r\nHandout #7.

       "title":"What is Cluster Feeding?",
       "tipDescription":"Cluster feeding can be an intimidating expression for new parents. It is the term used for when a baby's feeding times are bunched together. Cluster feeding is very common in newborns and young babies. Some mothers also report cluster feeding with older babies who are approaching a growth spurt.\r\n\r\nWhen babies space their feedings closer together at certain times of the day, it can often be followed by a longer sleep period than usual. It can be exasperating for new moms battling exhaustion because cluster feeding can feel never ending. It most often occurs in the evening; however, cluster feeding can happen at any time of the day. Babies are often more fussy during periods of cluster feeding, or rather, cluster feeding often coincides with your baby's fussy time. Nursing, snoozing, crying, nursing, snoozing, nursing, nursing, nursing, crying, snoozing, crying, and nursing again. It feels like baby is nursing constantly, while they are pulling off, fussing, nursing, then fussing again.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you need to know about cluster feeding is that it is perfectly normal, and there is nothing wrong with your milk supply. In fact, this is exactly how babies increase the supply; by demand. While it can be unsatisfying when baby is fussy and hungry right after nursing, it does not mean you aren't making enough milk and need to supplement. On the contrary, giving your baby a bottle will only tell your body that you need less milk, not more. Studies show that after baby is born, the supply of milk is no longer driven primarily by hormones, but by milk removal, which is driven by baby's appetite. That means, the more baby grows, the more baby eats; the more baby eats, the more milk your body produces. Cluster feeding actually helps stimulate that increase in supply.\r\n\r\nIt is natural for nursing mothers to worry about whether their babies are getting enough milk. The fussiness and frequency of cluster feeding can increase those worries. Remember that it is normal for nursing babies to eat more often, as breast milk is digested faster than formula, and cluster feeding is a normal pattern in breastfed babies. Also, formula fed babies experience fussy periods as well, but breastfed mothers have a built-in way to comfort them. Cluster feeding is often most noticeable during growth spurts, and babies unquestionably have more than their fair share of those! The best thing you can do to keep up with your baby's feeding demands during a period of clustering is to keep yourself hydrated and comfortable. Don't be afraid to follow your baby's cues on when they want to be fed. Even babies who previously kept a spaced-out routine in feedings can suddenly experience growth spurts and start cluster feeding. Trust your body and baby to find the way through these changes and work to a new rhythm naturally. Have patience and if possible, recruit help from dad or others to work around these draining hours by bringing you plenty of water, snacks and stress relieving activities. Cluster feeding can seem daunting, but it is also a wonderful sign of exciting growth for baby and your journey of motherhood."

       "title":"Breastfeeding and Other Foods",
       "tipDescription":"Introduction \r\n\r\nBreastmilk is the only food your baby needs until at least 4 months of age and most babies do very well on breastmilk alone for 6 months or more. There is no advantage to adding other sorts of foods or milks to breastmilk before 4 to 6 months, except under unusual or extraordinary circumstances. Many of the situations in which breastmilk seems to require addition of other foods arise from misunderstandings about how breastfeeding works, and\/or originate from a poor start at establishing breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nSolid Foods (see also handout #16 Starting Solid Foods) \r\n\r\nBreastfed babies normally do not require solid foods before 6 months of age. Indeed, many do not require solid foods until 9 months or more of age, if we can judge by their weight gain and iron status. However, there are some babies who will have great difficulty learning to accept solid food if not started before 7-9 months of age. Because the six month old baby will also soon need to have an additional source of iron, it is generally recommended and convenient that solids be introduced around 6 months of age. Some babies show great interest in grabbing food off the table by 5 months, and there is no reason not to allow them to start taking the food and playing with it and putting it in their mouths and eating it. \r\n\r\nIt has been the habit of physicians to suggest that babies be started first on cereals and then other foods be added. However, the 6 month old is far different from the 4 month old. Many 6 month old babies do not seem to like cereal if it is introduced at this time. Do not push the baby to take it, but offer other foods, and perhaps try again when your baby is a little older. But if he refuses, do not worry he will be missing something. There is nothing magic about cereal and babies do fine without it. Anyhow, your baby may soon be eating bread. The best way for the baby of getting additional iron is by eating meat. \r\n\r\nThere is no good reason why a baby needs to eat or be introduced to only one food per week, or why vegetables should be started before fruits. Anyone worried about the sweetness of fruit has not tasted breastmilk. The six month old can be given almost anything off his parents' plate that can be mashed with a fork. \r\n\r\nFar fewer feeding problems will occur if a relaxed approach to feeding is taken. \r\n\r\nBreastmilk, cow's milk, formula, outside work and bottles (see also handout #17 What to feed the baby when the mother is working outside the home) \r\n\r\nA breastfeeding baby who is older than about 4 months will not likely take a bottle if he has not already gotten used to one. This is no loss or disadvantage. At about 6 months or even younger, the baby can start learning to use a cup, and usually will be quite good at drinking from a cup by about 7-8 months of age, if not sooner. If the mother is returning to paid work at about 6 months, there is also no need to start bottles or formula. In this situation, solids may be started somewhat earlier than 6 months of age (say 4 or 5 months of age), so that by the time the mother is working outside the home, the baby can be getting most of his food and liquid off a spoon when the mother is not with him. As he gets older, the cup may be used more and more for liquids. You and the baby can manage without his taking bottles. Do not try to starve the baby into taking a bottle if he refuses to accept one. Your baby is not being stubborn, but does not know how to use an artificial nipple. He also may not like the taste of formula, which is understandable. \r\n\r\nThough there has been a lot of publicity recently about not giving babies cow's milk until at least 9 months, this does not really apply to breastfeeding babies. The breastfeeding baby can take some of his milk as cow's milk after about 6 months of age, especially if he is starting to take substantial amounts of a wide variety of solids as well. Goat's milk is an alternative. Many breastfeeding babies will not drink formula because they do not like the taste. Actually, the breastfeeding baby can get all the milk he needs from the breast without his requiring other sorts of milk, even if he is nursing only a few times a day. \r\n\r\nMy 4 month old is hungry on breast only. Solids or Formula? \r\n\r\nThere is no advantage in this situation of giving formula by bottle and there may be some disadvantage. Even at this age a baby may start to prefer the bottle if he seems not to getting enough from the breast (if, in fact, he will accept a bottle). It would be preferable in this circumstance to give solids off a spoon rather than to give formula in a bottle. (Frequently, however, this situation can be remedied differently by improving the breastfeeding-get help). If you wish to mix formula with solids, that does not cause the same sort of problem as giving it in a bottle. If the baby seems hungry after breastfeeding, feed him solids off a spoon. However, it may be possible with a simple techniques, to get the baby gaining well, and\/or to be satisfied with breastfeeding alone. Check with the clinic. \r\n\r\nHandout #10.

       "title":"Finger Feeding",
       "tipDescription":"Introduction \r\n\r\nFinger feeding is a technique which allows you to feed the baby without giving the baby an artificial nipple. Finger feeding is also a method which helps train the baby to take the breast. If you want to breastfeed successfully, it is better to avoid the use of artificial nipples before your milk supply is well established.\r\n\r\nFinger feeding may be used if: \r\n\r\nThe baby refuses the breast for whatever reason, or if the baby is too sleepy at the breast to nurse well. It is also a very good way to wake up a sleepy baby. \r\n\r\nThe baby does not seem to be able to latch on to the breast properly, and thus does not get milk well. (If a lactation aid can be used at the breast, why use finger feeding?). \r\n\r\nThe baby is separated from the mother, for whatever reason. However, in such a situation, a cup is probably a better method of feeding the baby. \r\n\r\nBreastfeeding is stopped temporarily (there are very few legitimate reasons to stop breastfeeding. See handout #9 You Can Still Breastfeed). \r\n\r\nYour nipples are so sore that you cannot put the baby to the breast. Finger feeding for several days may allow your nipples to heal without causing more problems by getting the baby used to an artificial nipple. Cup feeding is also more appropriate in this situation and takes less time. This is only a last resort. Proper positioning and a good latch help sore nipples far more frequently than finger feeding (Handout #3 Sore Nipples). \r\n\r\nFinger feeding is much more similar to breastfeeding than bottle feeding is. In order to finger feed, the baby must keep his tongue down and forward over the gums, the mouth wide open (the larger the finger used, the better), and the jaw forward. Furthermore, the motion of the tongue and jaw is similar to what the baby does while feeding at the breast. Finger feeding is best used to prepare the baby to take the breast. Cup feeding is usually easier and faster when the mother is not present to feed the baby. \r\n\r\nPlease Note: If the baby is taking the breast, it is better by far to use the lactation at the breast, if supplementation is truly necessary (Handout #5 Using a Lactation Aid). \r\n\r\nFinger Feeding (best learned by watching and doing) \r\n\r\nWash your hands. It is better if the finger nail on the finger you will use has been cut short, but this is not necessary. \r\n\r\nIt is best to position yourself and the baby comfortably. The baby's head should be supported with one hand behind his shoulders and neck, the baby should be on your lap, half seated, and facing you. Any position which is comfortable, however, will do. \r\n\r\nYou will need a lactation aid, made up of a feeding tube (#5F, 36\" long), and a feeding bottle with expressed breast milk, sugar water, or, if necessary, formula, depending on the circumstances. The feeding tube is passed through the enlarged nipple hole into the fluid. \r\n\r\nLine up the tube so that it sits on the soft part of your index (or other) finger. The end of the tube should line up no further than the end of your finger. It is easiest to grip the tube, about where it makes a gentle curve, between your thumb and middle finger and then position your index finger under the tube. If this is done properly, there is no need to tape the tube to your finger. \r\n\r\nUsing the finger with the tube, tickle the baby's lips lightly, until the baby opens up his mouth enough to allow your finger to enter. If the baby is very sleepy, but needs to be fed, the finger may be gently insinuated into his mouth. Generally, the baby will begin to suckle even if asleep, and receiving liquids will then awaken him. \r\n\r\nInsert your finger with the tube so that the soft part of your finger remains upwards. Keep your finger as flat as possible. Usually the baby will begin sucking on the finger, and allow the finger to enter quite far. The baby will not usually gag on your finger even if it is in his mouth quite far, unless the baby is full or used to bottles. \r\n\r\nPull down the baby's chin, if his lower lip is sucked in. \r\n\r\nThe technique is working if the baby is drinking. If feeding is very slow, you may raise the bottle above the baby's head. Try to keep your finger straight, flattening the baby's tongue. Try not to point your finger up, but keep it flat, thus keeping down the baby's tongue, and working the lower jaw forward. \r\n\r\nThe use of finger feeding with a syringe to push milk into the baby's mouth, is, in my opinion, too difficult and definitely not more effective than simply using a bottle with the nipple hole enlarged and the tube coming from it. \r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble getting the baby to latch on to or to suckle at the breast, remember that a ravenous baby can make the going very difficult. Take the edge of his hunger by using the finger feeding technique for a minute or so. Once the baby has settled a little, and sucks well on your finger (usually only a minute or so), try offering the breast again. If you still encounter difficulty, do not be discouraged. Go back to finger feeding and try again later in the feed or next feeding. This technique usually works. Sometimes several days, or on occasion a week or more, of finger feeding are necessary, however. \r\n\r\nIf you are leaving the hospital finger feeding the baby, make an appointment with the clinic within a day or so of discharge. The earlier the better. \r\n\r\nOnce the baby is taking the breast, he may still require the lactation aid to supplement for a period of time. Although the baby may take the breast, the latch can still be less than ideal, and the suckle may still not be efficient enough to ensure adequate intake. \r\n\r\nHandout #8. Finger Feeding.

       "title":"What Is a Nursing Strike?",
       "tipDescription":"You and your baby have developed a good, solid breastfeeding routine when suddenly baby simply won't nurse. Baby is hungry and upset. She is cranky and wants to eat-but refuses. What is going on? Is it time to wean? What should you do? Unfortunately, you have a nursing strike on your hands-a nursing strike is when an older baby with an established breastfeeding pattern suddenly refuses the breast entirely.\r\n\r\nMany parents confuse a nursing strike with self-weaning. Very few babies under the age of one will wean themselves. Weaning is typically a slow process that is comfortable for both mother and baby, not a sudden refusal to breastfeed. A nursing strike is baby telling you that something is wrong. There are some common causes, and with an adjustment or two, you will be able to put an end to the nursing strike and bring baby back to breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nCommon Causes of Nursing Strikes\r\n\r\nA stuffy nose or ear infection : For a stuffy nose, try saline drops or an aspirator at mealtimes. Contact your doctor's office if you suspect an ear infection.\r\n\r\nAn infection such as hand-foot-and-mouth disease or thrush: Thrush (in both your baby and yourself) must be treated by a doctor. Hand-foot-and-mouth disease typically runs its course, but contact your doctor.\r\n\r\nSore gums from teething: Try to bring baby some relief with counter pressure, by allowing them to chew on soft frozen fruit in a teething bag, a chilled teething ring or your favorite method.\r\n\r\nYou smell \"wrong\" to your baby : Have you changed your soap, lotion, detergent, shampoo, or other product recently? Try changing back if your new and unfamiliar scent might be the issue.\r\n\r\nYour milk may taste different: Have you been eating a lot of spicy food or a lot of anything in particular? If you have made a dietary change, try lessening the amount of the new food you are eating, or add back some of what you cut out. Hormonal changes can also cause a change in your milk's taste. Also, the imminent return of your period or a new pregnancy can also change your milk's taste.\r\n\r\nFamily stress-moving, house guests, a new job, a new daily schedule: Give baby extra attention, increase cuddling and skin-to-skin contact. Consider a carrying sling to give baby extra reassurance that everything is OK-and to allow you to multitask (doing simple chores, visiting with guests, helping other children with homework).\r\n\r\nBaby was frightened while nursing: Maybe you yelped when baby bit you in a recent nursing session or an older sibling came screaming into the room? Did the dog start ferociously barking at something outside? Try the same techniques as listed for family stress. Baby needs extra reassuring and comforting.\r\n\r\nBaby is overly impatient with your naturally slow letdown : Try starting milk letdown (manually or with a pump) before offering baby the breast.\r\n\r\nOther Ideas\r\n\r\nTry offering baby the breast when he or she is very sleepy. He or she may be less likely to notice a different smell, taste, soreness, or any distractions.\r\n\r\nTry skin-on-skin nursing in a quiet, darkened room.\r\n\r\nPump! Pumping will help keep up your milk supply, and also provides milk that you can store in the refrigerator to use for feeding baby with a bottle or cup.\r\n\r\nContact your local La Leche League for support in continuing to breastfeed, find a lactation consultant at the local hospital or lactation center for help, or visit your doctor."

       "title":"Mommy Tips for Drying up Breast Milk",
       "tipDescription":"If you are having a baby and not planning to breastfeed, you may be interested in hearing the quickest ways to dry up your breast milk. Your milk will dry up on its own within a week or so if you do not nurse. You may, however, experience engorgement after your milk comes in. There are some things you can do to help relieve the discomfort of being engorged. If you have not made up your mind about breastfeeding, you may want to pump your breast milk until you decide. If you are sure that you do not want to breastfeed or if you cannot breastfeed, here are our best tips for drying up.\r\n\r\nHow to dry up breast milk and relieve breast engorgement\r\n\r\nWear a snug fitting bra. Place refrigerated cabbage leaves inside your bra for a couple of hours or till they wilt. Cabbage leaves have been used for years to help relieve engorgement. We do not know exactly why cabbage leaves help with engorgement but some researchers believe that there are substances in the cabbage that help to reduce swelling and inflammation. Break up the cabbage leaves so that there are no hard veins in them. Arrange them in your bra so they are comfortable and there are no hard spots pressing against your breast. Do not use cabbage leaves if you are allergic to cabbage or sulfa. Use ice packs or frozen vegetables for compresses. Use cold compresses for twenty minutes a few times a day. Do not put ice or frozen veggies directly on your skin. Use a towel between the ice and skin. You may have used heat before to relieve discomfort; this is not advised for engorgement. Warm compresses may encourage your milk to let down and increase milk production. Use an anti-inflammatory medication, such as ibuprophen, as needed. Do not pump. Pumping will signal your body to make more milk. Your body works on supply and demand. If you empty your breast, your body will think that it needs to make milk. When your breast becomes full it signals your body to make less milk. If you are very engorged, hand expressing milk is okay, but just empty enough to relieve discomfort. There is no point in being miserable while you are drying out. Drink a few cups of sage tea daily. Sage has properties in it that inhibit milk production. Do not restrict water intake. Some moms try to dry out milk by drinking less. Restricting your fluids will not reduce your engorgement and may lead to dehydration."

       "title":"Breastfeeding Oversupply",
       "tipDescription":"A breastfeeding oversupply happens when your body starts producing more milk than your baby needs. This is actually a problem, because babies often won't receive enough nutrition if mom is putting out too much milk. It can be uncomfortable for both the mother and baby, and can make a baby fussy. Here is what you need to know about a breastfeeding oversupply, and what you can do about it.\r\n\r\nSymptoms of Breastfeeding Oversupply\r\n\r\nA forceful letdown of milk from your breast is one of the most common symptoms that can tell you that you have an oversupply. Milk will often leak or even squirt out when the baby releases from the nipple. Imagine trying to drink from a fire hose, and that's an approximation of what a baby goes through when drinking from an overfull breast. The excess pressure from too much milk is more than the baby can handle.\r\n\r\nBabies will often exhibit some of the following symptoms from a breastfeeding oversupply:\r\n\r\nChoking, coughing or sputtering during feedings Frequent burping and gas between feedings Crying and general fussiness, similar to colic Biting the nipple during feedings Green, liquid or foamy stools \r\n\r\nMothers can look for the following signs of a breastfeeding oversupply in themselves:\r\n\r\nMilk ducts frequently become plugged Sore nipples Milk sprays out when the baby releases the nipple Breasts feel overfull most of the time Short feedings of 5 to 10 minutes \r\n\r\nForemilk and Hindmilk\r\n\r\nIt is important to understand foremilk and hindmilk when you are dealing with an oversupply. The foremilk is what comes out initially during a breastfeeding. It is high in lactose (milk sugar), but it doesn't have as much milk fat. The hindmilk is creamier, and contains the milk fat that babies especially need. The milk fat has more nutrition and fills the baby up.\r\n\r\nWhen you have a breast milk oversupply, the baby will be drinking foremilk until he fills up, but might not be receiving any hindmilk. As a result, he will soon be hungry again. Think of it like this: If you're really hungry, you can fill your stomach up with juice. This will make you feel full and will even give you some calories. However, you will soon be hungry again, because you didn't receive any substantive nutrition from the juice. This is what life is like for a baby that drinks mostly foremilk.\r\n\r\nCauses of Breastfeeding Oversupply\r\n\r\nFor some mothers, an oversupply just happens. Their body is stimulated to be producing milk, and it puts out over and above what's needed. In other cases, some mismanagement and outdated lactation advice can contribute to the problem. For example, if a mother is experiencing forceful letdowns, she may pump a lot of milk out prior to feeding, in order to ease the force of the milk pressure. While this will make it easier for the baby to feed, it sends the mother's body a signal that it needs to produce more milk! The body then \"reprograms\" itself to overproduce milk.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief in many cultures that you should nurse the baby for a few minutes on each breast at every feeding, so that you don't drain the breast completely. However, this is not a good practice because it causes the baby to fill up on the foremilk in each breast, and never consume enough hindmilk. This, in turn, causes the baby to consume too much milk sugar, causing digestive problems. If you have an oversupply of milk and use this breastfeeding tactic it can be stressful for you and your baby. The best strategy is to drain each breast completely during a feeding, even if baby only nurses from one breast during an entire feeding. You can switch to the other breast at the next feeding.\r\n\r\nDealing with a Breastfeeding Oversupply\r\n\r\nIt will take a little bit of work, but you can help your body adjust to producing less milk and therefore make feeding time healthier and more enjoyable for both of you. Start feeding on just one breast if you're not already doing so. Let the baby fill up on one side, and then feed on the same side at the next feeding. Switch to the other breast at the following feeding. This will gradually slow your milk production, because your body will realize that it doesn't need to produce as much milk. Note that this can make you uncomfortable in the breast that's not being used for feeding. You can hand pump or express small amounts from the \"off breast\" to relieve discomfort, but don't do this excessively. Otherwise your body will continue overproducing milk.\r\n\r\nOveractive Breasts\r\n\r\nIf the strategy to reduce your milk production doesn't work, you might have to take it to a more extreme level (consult with a lactation specialist first, though). One strategy that is recommended is to thoroughly pump both breasts about an hour before feeding time. Do this until the breasts are soft but not empty. Then feed the baby on one breast until it feels very soft (empty), and the other side feels extremely full. Switch sides at this point, and feed until that breast empties and the other side refills. You might need to pump both sides a second time during the day to prevent plugged milk ducts. Your body should start producing less milk in a few days.\r\n\r\nForceful Letdowns\r\n\r\nSome slight pumping may be necessary to relieve the pressure from forceful letdowns. This can be counterproductive, though, because it can trigger your body to start overproducing milk. Another strategy is to change the position of the baby during feedings. Leaning back in a reclining chair and having the baby lay across you in an upright position can help. This position allows gravity to help, because the milk has to travel upward. Feeding in a side position (lying down with the baby next to you) can also help, because the excess milk can dribble out onto a towel, reducing the downward force of the milk as seen with the classical feeding position (baby in your lap and positioned beneath the breast). If you gently pinch the nipple between two fingers while feeding you can reduce a forceful milk flow."

       "title":"Dairy Elimination Diet for Breastfeeding Moms",
       "tipDescription":"Allergies to dairy products are among the most prevalent food allergies in babies. Between 2 and 3 percent of babies develop dairy sensitivity, but the sensitivity typically disappears with aging. Babies may develop rashes and loose stools or diarrhea as a consequence of food allergies. If you are breastfeeding and consume dairy products, eliminating these should be a priority, because all you eat is processed and present in the breast milk.\r\n\r\nIs Dairy the Problem?\r\n\r\nCow's milk contains a protein that is the culprit causing the allergic reactions. The baby's immune system doesn't tolerate this protein and responds with symptoms such as an upset stomach, diarrhea (often with blood in it), gagging, bloating, lack of appetite, itchy bumps on skin and skin rashes. The baby will also be irritable.\r\n\r\nDiagnosing dairy sensitivity is problematic in babies. Your doctor may examine the baby and run a skin test that involves injecting a small amount of milk protein under the baby's skin. If the baby has a negative reaction to the injection, the diagnosis is clear.\r\n\r\nThe Dairy Elimination Diet\r\n\r\nIf your baby is allergic to the milk protein, you should eliminate your intake of milk and other dairy products, because the protein gets into the breast milk and enters the baby's system when he nurses. Check all products you eat and drink to ensure that they don't contain milk, cheese, yogurt or other dairy products. As of 2006, all food and beverage producers are required to state whether their products contain milk or milk-based ingredients. Avoid foods that contain artificial butter flavor, butter, butterfat, buttermilk, cheeses, custard, casein, lactose, milk, nougat, pudding, sour cream, whey or yogurt. Other ingredients that may indicate that milk protein is present in the product include margarine, high protein flour, caramel and chocolate.\r\n\r\nMake sure you get your calcium requirements from different foods such as kale, broccoli or spinach, or take a calcium supplement. Calcium is essential when you breastfeed, and a calcium deficiency can lead to health problems.\r\n\r\nHow Long Does It Take to Get Dairy out of Your System?\r\n\r\nMilk protein can be eliminated completely from a person’s system anywhere from 4 hours to 4 days, depending on her metabolism and the amount of dairy products she has consumed. If you have a dairy intolerance, your system may take on the longer end of this time range to digest the milk products. However, after 4 days of avoiding dairy products, you can be sure that the milk protein is no longer in your system, so your baby will no longer develop allergic reactions to it. Your baby may have allergy symptoms for up to 4 days after you fed him the last milk contaminated with dairy protein. If the allergic reactions persist beyond that time, check with your doctor, because your baby may be allergic to a different ingredient.\r\n\r\nProblems That Mimic Dairy Sensitivities\r\n\r\nBabies may be allergic to other ingredients in your diet including soy, nuts, eggs, gluten or wheat. The only way to determine the cause of your baby's symptoms is to have him tested for the ingredients you suspect are causing the allergic reactions.\r\n\r\nIn addition, babies with dairy sensitivities may have symptoms that mimic reflux, such as frequent spitting up, coughing, and wheezing. Before testing your baby for reflux, your doctor may advise you to eliminate dairy from your diet to see if his symptoms improve."

       "title":"How Long Should a Baby Breastfeed on Each Breast?",
       "tipDescription":"Women are often given very specific instructions on how long and how often to breastfeed their babies. In the hospital you may have been advised to feed your baby for ten minutes on the first breast and then ten minutes on the other breast and to do this every 2 to 3 hours.\r\n\r\nDuring your baby’s first few days of life, it’s important to get off to a good start with breastfeeding. A baby should be fed whenever she is hungry or “on demand.” When your baby is a newborn she may be really sleepy and not very demanding when it comes to breastfeeding. This is why you may have been instructed to feed your baby for at least 10 minutes on each breast during a feeding. You want to make sure your baby is getting plenty of time at both breasts to make sure your breasts are getting stimulation and your supply gets off to a good start. Since breastfeeding works by supply and demand, the more frequently your baby empties your breasts, the more milk you will make. \r\n\r\nAllow your baby to nurse as long as she wants on the first breast\r\n\r\nHowever, while ten minutes per breast is a good minimum guideline, it’s not a rule and you really don’t want to limit your baby’s time at the breast. Some babies are more efficient nursers and can empty the breast in 5 to 10 minutes, while others take longer. The best approach is to let baby nurse as long as she wants on the first breast before offering the second breast. Don’t watch the clock; instead watch your baby. This way you can be sure your baby is nursing long enough to get to the fattier high-calorie hindmilk.\r\n\r\nSigns that your baby has emptied the first breast\r\n\r\nSometimes it’s hard for moms to tell when a baby is ready for the second breast. The best thing to do is to wait until your baby comes off the breast on her own. When your baby is full and satisfied, she will have what breastfeeding moms describe as a “drunken sailor” look. She’ll pull off the breast, sometimes with a little milk dripping from her lips, and look quite content. \r\n\r\nSometimes a baby just doesn’t come off the breast though. She may continue to nurse, but will stop sucking vigorously. You can either allow her to keep nursing until she falls asleep or pulls off the breast, or if you see that her nursing has slowed down and you are no longer hearing active swallowing, you can gently slide your finger into her mouth to break the seal and then offer her the other breast. \r\n\r\nAnother way to tell if your breast is empty is to just squeeze your nipple to see if milk comes out. Keep in mind that your breasts are never truly empty. Your body is constantly producing more milk. But, if you squeeze your nipple and nothing comes out or it takes a lot of work to squeeze anything out, this is a good sign that your baby is ready for the second breast."

       "title":"Breastmilk And Booze - Do The Two Mix?",
       "tipDescription":"Did you know there’s a new product on the market that enables you to test you breast milk for the presence of alcohol? And did you know that it’s completely unnecessary? \r\n\r\nDesigned by two moms, Milkscreen works as follows: Saturate the test pad with some breast milk, wait two minutes, and if the pad changes color, voila! Alcohol is present in your milk. This information is supposed to help you decide whether or not it’s “safe” to nurse after having had that beer on a hot summer night.\r\n\r\nSo what’s the problem?\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to alcohol, there’s a huge difference between getting roaring drunk and having an occasional glass of wine. Milkscreen does not differentiate. Either there’s alcohol in your milk, or there’s not. The results are the same whether you had a single glass of champagne, a full six-pack, or even a dose of NyQuil.\r\n\r\nExperts agree that drinking alcohol in moderation is not incompatible with breastfeeding. “Prohibiting alcohol is another way we make life unnecessarily restrictive for nursing mothers,” asserts Dr. Jack Newman, author of numerous books and articles on breastfeeding and a member of the LLLI Health Advisory Council. And the more rules associated with breastfeeding, the less likely they will nurse, adds lactation consultant Amy Spangler. “Mothers need to trust themselves,” Spangler says. “They don’t need to test their milk.”\r\n\r\nWomen take plenty of over-the-counter and prescription medication and continue to safely nurse their children. Even smokers are encouraged to nurse because in spite of the presence of nicotine in their milk, their own milk is still preferable to formula. And why the obsession of breast milk safety in the first place? As lactation consultant Linda Smith asserts, “Nobody is marketing a test for the safety of formula!”\r\n\r\nFormula remains a far more risky choice than good old-fashioned breast milk. In her fascinating and provocative book, Having Faith: An Ecologist’s Journey to Motherhood, biologist Sandra Steingraber presents a frightening assessment of the degree to which traces of pesticides and toxic chemicals are found in the breast milk of women all over the planet. Yet Steingraber remains a staunch proponent of breastfeeding and indeed nursed her own children for several years each. Why? Because formula is still riskier than breast milk, even when that that milk has traces of alcohol in it. “We spend an awful lot of time balancing small theoretical hazards of breast milk against actual hazards of formula,” asserts lactation consultant Diane Wiessinger.\r\n\r\nA Balanced View\r\n\r\nI’m not trying to be cavalier about alcohol. Excessive drinking can affect your baby’s ability to nurse effectively and can inhibit milk production, as well. But experts agree that drinking in moderation is not incompatible with breastfeeding. And a little judgment and common sense are at least as effective as a simplistic test. Are you drinking on an empty or full stomach? (Food decreases the absorption of alcohol.) How much will you be drinking? (The more you feel the affects, the more your baby will; the more you drink, the longer it will take for the affects to wear off.) How do you metabolize alcohol? (Heavier people can metabolize alcohol more quickly than lighter folks.) Finally, how old is your baby? )A newborn’s liver is immature and he will feel the effects of alcohol more than an older baby.)\r\n\r\nThe bottom line? If you drink a lot, don’t nurse. And seek help. Heavy drinking will affect your mothering ability in more areas than breastfeeding. But breast milk is rarely a dangerous substance from which babies need protection. “If a mother is so drunk that she’s at risk of dropping the baby,” asserts lactation consultant Linda Smith, “she needs help with the baby!”"

       "title":"Breastfeeding a Premature Baby",
       "tipDescription":"Breastfeeding, although it may be more challenging with a preemie, is one great thing you can do to help your little guy or gal get off to the best start. Breastfeeding provides the perfect nutrition for a premature infant because your breast milk automatically adapts to your baby’s needs; something formula just can’t do. This is so important for a premature baby because your breast milk not only provides just the right amount of calories, fatty acids, vitamins, and protein for your premature baby, but it also helps your baby in other ways. Your breast milk is perfectly suited for your baby. It is more easily digested than formula which is particularly important for preemies as their digestive systems are not as mature as full term babies. Scientists have yet to figure out how to replicate all the ingredients that are found in breast milk. Breast milk contains nutritive components as well as components that help fight infection. In fact, about 80% of the cells in breast milk are macrophages. Macrophages are cells that help fight off viruses and infections. Because preemies face a higher risk of infection, feeding your baby breast milk is even more important. By breastfeeding your premature baby, you will help protect her delicate and immature immune system and give her the best nutrition possible. \r\n\r\nBefore you start breastfeeding\r\n\r\nIf your baby arrives early you may not be able to breastfeed her right away. Premature babies are often fed through a nasogastric tube to start off with, especially if your baby is born before 33 weeks. Babies do not develop the suck-swallow-breathe reflex that is needed for breastfeeding until they are about 32-33 weeks gestation. To help your baby get ready to breastfeed there are some things you can do. You should talk to your hospital caregivers to help you and your baby prepare for breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nGet lots of skin to skin contact with your baby. Many hospitals encourage “kangaroo care” for premature babies. Before your baby can start kangaroo care, she needs to be stable enough that she can breathe on her own, or have minimal breathing support, and she also needs to be able to maintain a normal heart rate, oxygen level, and body temperature while she is being held. Kangaroo care is a type of skin to skin contact that gives moms and preemies a way to bond. It also helps preemies prepare for breastfeeding and has provides other health benefits for preemies.\r\n\r\nPump breast milk for your baby. Your preemie probably won’t be able to breastfeed right away, but you can still provide her the best nutrition by pumping breast milk for her. Pumping is very important when you have a preemie because your baby will not be sucking at the breast and stimulating your body to produce milk. The first few weeks after a baby is born are critical for establishing a good milk supply. If your baby isn’t nursing at the breast you will need to stimulate your breasts to produce milk by pumping. Your hospital will probably provide you a hospital grade pump while you are in the hospital, but after that you may need to rent a hospital grade pump. You can also purchase a double electric pump like Medela’s Pump in Style; however, a hospital grade pump is preferable when pumping for a preemie.\r\n\r\nPumping for a Preemie\r\n\r\nKeep everything you pump, no matter how small the amount. When you first start pumping for your preemie you may only produce very small amounts of a yellowish substance called colostrum. It may seem like a minute amount and you may even wonder if it is enough to bother saving. Colostrum is very important for your preemie because it is very rich in carbohydrates, protein and protective antibodies. You should keep whatever you pump even if it just a few drops. Your baby will not eat very much during his first feedings so every little bit you can pump is important and should be kept.\r\n\r\nPump frequently. Since your preemie is so little, you may find it very easy to pump enough milk to meet his needs. Because of this, you may be tempted to pump less frequently. You should pump about every three to four hours, even if you are producing more milk than your baby is taking at the hospital. You can always freeze the extra milk to save for later. Plan to pump every three hours for about 10-15 minutes using a double electric pump. At night you can go a little longer between pumping sessions, but you should not go longer than five hours without pumping. Ideally, your pumping routine should mimic your baby’s eating routine so that once your baby starts nursing at the breast, your body is already in a similar routine as your baby. It is important to pump frequently because pumping frequently helps establish a good milk supply. Preemies often have a weaker suck and may not nurse as efficiently as full term babies. Pumping will help you to develop a good milk supply and hopefully once your baby gets stronger she will be able to nurse well enough to maintain this supply. \r\n\r\nDrink plenty of water. Drink a large glass of water about an hour before you plan to sit down to pump. You may also want to keep a glass of water nearby while you are pumping because pumping can sometimes make you thirsty. \r\n\r\nMassage your breasts before you pump. Massaging your breasts may help you to pump more. Try massaging your breasts before you pump. You can also try massaging your breasts after you have pumped for a while and notice that you are no longer pumping any milk. Watch for when your breasts stop producing milk. When you notice this take a break from pumping for a few minutes, massage your breasts and pump again. By using this technique, you may be able to pump as much as an ounce of extra milk or more for your baby.\r\n\r\nStoring pumped milk\r\n\r\nWhen you pump your breast milk, you should store it in small bags or containers. You can purchase special storage bags to keep your breast milk in. Ask your hospital caregivers how much you should store per bag and if it is okay for you to bring in frozen breast milk. Some hospitals do not allow the use frozen breast milk. Label your breast milk with your baby’s name and what date the milk was collected. The hospital will use the milk in order of when it is dated. See Breast milk storage guidelines for more information on how to store your breast milk.\r\n\r\nBreastfeeding your preemie\r\n\r\nOnce your baby is strong enough to breastfeed, your hospital caregivers will help you get started. Your baby may start out by just licking at your breast. She may suck at the breast for a while before she actually starts to swallow any milk. Preemies take a lot longer than full term babies to nurse. It may take her as long as 40 minutes to an hour for just one feeding. If she refuses to suck or keeps falling asleep, you should stop nursing and try again later. If you find the process is frustrating, you may want to work with a lactation consultant to help you. Your preemie may not suck well enough to empty your breasts when she nurses. For this reason, it is a good idea to pump after she nurses to make sure that your breast is emptied. Preemies may only nurse on one breast per feeding. This is not uncommon or something to worry about. To keep your supply up, you may want to pump the other breast after your baby nurses.\r\n\r\nBreastfed preemies may need a supplement\r\n\r\nYour doctor may advise you to give your baby a special supplement. Supplements can be added to your breast milk. You can even give your baby a supplement while you breastfeed by using a special tube feeding devise that allows your baby to nurse and take the supplement at the same time. This may seem discouraging to a breastfeeding mom, but supplementing will help your baby to thrive. Once your baby gains weight and starts breastfeeding better, you can work with your doctor on weaning from the supplement."

This sheet provides information on how your baby can be fed when you are not with him. It is addressed in particular to the mother who is returning to paid work when the baby is about 6 months of age. New mothers should stay home with their babies for as long as practical and take full advantage of the 26 weeks maternity leave to which mothers have a right in Canada. Your baby will never be this age again. \r\n\r\nSome Myths:\r\n\r\n1. Babies must learn to take a bottle so that they can be fed when the mother is not there. \r\n\r\nNot true. Some exclusively breastfed babies will not take a bottle by 2 or 3 months of age. Most, who have not taken a bottle, and even some who did accept a bottle in the first weeks of life will not take one by the time they are 4 or 5 months of age. This is no tragedy, and there is no reason to give a bottle early so that the baby knows how. If your baby is refusing to take a bottle, do not try to force him; you and he may become very frustrated and there is just no need to go through all this. If the baby is 6 months of age when you start back at outside work, the baby quite simply does not need to take a bottle. He can be fed solids off a spoon just as any other 6 month old and by 6 months of age he can be taking enough so that he will not be hungry during the day. Furthermore, he can start learning to drink from a cup even by 5 or 6 months of age. The cup can be an open cup and does not need to have a spout. Start with water as your baby may spill a fair amount at first. If, however, he has not gotten the hang of the cup by the time you must leave him, do not worry, he can take fluids off a spoon, or the solid foods can be mixed with more liquid (expressed milk, juice). Obviously, if the baby is to be taking a fair amount of a variety of foods by 6 months of age, he may need to be started on solids by 5 months of age. However, some babies prefer to wait for the mother in order to drink something. This is fine; many babies sleep 12 hours at night without drinking or eating at all. \r\n\r\n2. But getting the baby to take a bottle surely won't hurt. \r\n\r\nNot necessarily true. Some babies do fine with both. The occasional bottle, when breastfeeding is going well, will not hurt. But if the baby is getting several bottles a day on a regular basis, and, in addition, your milk supply decreases because the baby is nursing less, it is quite possible that the baby will start refusing the breast, even if he is older than 6 months of age. \r\n\r\n3. Babies need to drink milk when the mother is not at home. \r\n\r\nNot true. Three or four good nursings during a 24 hour period plus a variety of solid foods gives the baby all he needs, nutritionally, and thus he does not need any other type of milk when you are at your outside job. Of course, solid foods can be mixed with expressed milk or other milk, but this is not necessary. \r\n\r\n4. If the baby is to get milk other than breastmilk, it needs to be artificial baby milk (infant formula) until the baby is at least 9 months of age. \r\n\r\nNot true. If the baby is breastfeeding a few times a day and getting fair quantities of a variety of solid foods, infant formula is neither necessary nor desirable. Indeed, babies who have not had infant formula before 5 or 6 months of age often refuse to drink it because it tastes pretty bad. (If you want to convince yourself of how little we know about breastmilk, ask yourself why it is that though breastmilk and infant formulas have the same amount of sugar, breastmilk is so much sweeter). If you want to give the baby some other sort of milk, homogenized milk is acceptable at 6 months of age, as long as it is not the baby's only food. In fact, if the baby is taking good quantities of a wide variety of foods, breastfeeding 3 or 4 times a day, and growing well, homogenized milk or 2% milk is good enough, but also not necessary. \r\n\r\n5. Followup formulas (artificial milk for infants over 6 months of age) are specially adapted to the needs of infants 6 to 12 months of age. \r\n\r\nNot true. They are completely unnecessary and are specially adapted to the needs of the formula companies' profit margins. They also are part of a marketing strategy which tries to get around restrictions on the advertising of artificial baby milks directly to the public (widely disregarded in any case). In Europe now, there are special formulas available for the toddler (1-3 years of age). Some people will buy anything, it seems. But these toddler formulas will soon be here. You can bet on it. Bottom line über alles. \r\n\r\n6. The breastfed baby 4 months of age needs to be getting more iron than can be provided by breastmilk alone. \r\n\r\nNot true. For the baby the baby born at term who is breastfeeding exclusively, all the iron required is provided by breastmilk. However, by 6 months of age, more or less, it is prudent for the baby to begin getting more iron than that provided by breastmilk alone. \r\n\r\n7. The best way to assure the baby's getting enough iron is to give him infant cereals. \r\n\r\nNot true. Infant cereals do contain a lot of iron, but most of it is not absorbed, and this amount of iron seems to cause constipation in some babies. Furthermore, some breastfed babies who have had only breastmilk to 5 or 6 months of age do not like cereal. There is nothing wrong with infant cereal, but pushing this food on reluctant babies may result in later feeding problems. The best way to assure the baby is getting enough iron is to continue breastfeeding, and introduce solid foods in a relaxed, enjoyable way at the appropriate time (Handout #16 Starting Solid Foods). The appropriate time is when the baby is showing interest in eating by reaching out for and trying to eat food the parents or other members of the family are eating. This occurs usually about 4 1\/2 to 5 1\/2 months of age. A baby this age can eat what the parents eat, with few exceptions. There is no need to be obsessive about the order in which foods are introduced, or trying to keep the baby eating only one food\/week. The best source of extra iron for the 6 to 12 month old baby is meat, the iron of which is very well absorbed. Start feeding the baby solids in a way that makes eating enjoyable, and the baby will eat iron containing foods just fine. \r\n\r\nHandout #17 What to feed...

       "title":"Beyond the Nursery: Nursing with Confidence",
       "tipDescription":"Beyond the Nursery: Nursing with Confidence\r\nBy Barbara L. Behrmann, Ph.D. \r\n\r\nwww.breastfeedingcafe.com\r\n\r\nNiesha, a young mother in Arizona, was nursing her three week-old son in the baby department of a large discount store when the manager politely asked her to nurse in the bathroom because there were male customers who were their with their wives.\r\n\r\nAmy, enjoying a lunch out with her mother, discreetly nursed her daughter under her shirt. The waiter avoided eye contact with her and asked her mother, instead of her, for her lunch order.\r\n\r\nPatti, a modest woman in Washington, used to nurse in public bathrooms. She would put a lot of toilet seat covers on the seat and nurse on the toilet completely dressed. This kind of judgment, however, is not universal. Originally from Jamaica, Opal compares nursing in the US to her experiences overseas: “I remember going to Mexico when Shola was a baby and sitting on the side of the road, nursing. I didn’t cover my breast and nobody said anything to me. Nor did anyone say anything to me in Jamaica and St. Croix.”\r\n\r\nIn a culture that encourages us to show cleavage, but god forbid, our nipples, we typically try to be as discrete as possible. Ironically this means that the less visible we become and the more we hide the early work of mothering, the more approval we earn. We sling blankets over our shoulders, purchase special nursing tops, turn our backs to others, and ultimately try to disguise what we are doing. These, of course, may be good personal solutions, but they don’t help us change the culture.\r\n\r\nThe challenge we face is to nurse discreetly, but not invisibly. This way, we not only meet our babies’ all-important needs, but we also help each other; that is, the more others see mothers nursing publicly, the easier it will be for the next nursing mom.\r\n\r\nIncrease Your Confidence\r\n\r\nChances are, nobody will give you a hard time about nursing in public. But just in case, here are a few things to remember to boost your confidence.\r\n\r\nYou may start out feeling awkward and insecure, but over time you are likely to develop confidence and become more assertive. This is what happened with Stephanie. A first-time mother in Pennsylvania, she practiced nursing discreetly in front of mirrors and her husband. “I wanted to go places and do things but was so nervous that someone might get a glimpse of my bra as I opened it or, god forbid, a flash of skin,” she recalls. Her attitude changed after a few weeks and she became resentful and angry. “I never intended to fully disrobe in the mall but I hated the fact that I couldn’t focus on my daughter’s needs - I had to focus on whether somebody might be seeing more than they should.” Stephanie became increasingly defiant and after a few months would actually seek out places “that might ruffle a few feathers.” The law is on your side! In fact over 20 states have enacted legislation to clarify that women have the right to nurse in public without being accused of indecent exposure, lewd behavior or obscenity. : So…if anyone suggests you move to the bathroom to nurse, simply ask them if they’d like to eat their meal in a toilet stall and share with them this link: http:\/\/www.lalecheleague.org\/LawMain.html Don’t feel pressured to feed your baby expressed milk in a bottle. Not only is a pump less effective than a baby at removing milk from the breast, but lactation works on the principle of supply and demand. In some cases, pumping, instead of nursing, can diminish your milk supply. Besides, if your baby is nursing for comfort – or any other “non-nutritional” reason, he or she doesn’t want a bottle when your warm body is right there! If you’re nursling is past the babe-in-arms stage, he or she won’t care if you’re at home or in a shopping mall. You may want to nurse ahead of time and eventually you may be able to explain to your child that there are places where it’s ok to nurse and places where you have to wait. But again, know that you have the legal right to breastfeed. And international health organizations recommend nursing a child for at least two years. So if someone gives you a hard time, gently inform them that nurslings suckle for reasons beyond the milk. It calms them, comforts them, and meets their emotional needs. Humor may help. You can be pretty sure that by the time your child starts college he or she will be off the breast. In short, there is no reason to feel embarrassed for meeting your child’s nutritional and emotional needs. Generally, the more comfortable you are, the less likely others will challenge you. Remember the words of Nina, a first-time mother in upstate New York. “I love nursing in public and I don’t put a ton of effort into hiding it,” she admits. “I’m not saying breastfeeding should be about shock value, but I feel strongly about nursing and am proud of it. I don’t look down, I don’t feel embarrassed, and I look people right in the eye.” Remember, be discreet, but not invisible, confident but not aggressive. Use a blanket as a cover up, if you like, but if your baby won’t tolerate warm flannel over his head, who can blame him? Remember that nursing in public not only meets your baby’s needs, but does a public service."

       "title":"Weaning Regrets and Depression",
       "tipDescription":"In the world of new-mommies, breastfeeding is a popular topic; especially in the beginning. Lactation specialists will arrive unannounced at your hospital bedside, advising and aiding in latch-on methods, milk production tips, and pump problems. By the time weaning winds around, much of the transition talk has faded. The truth is, however, that hormonal and milestone changes can bring a mixture of transition when you board off the breastfeeding train. \r\n\r\nThe decision to wean comes more easily to some mothers than others, but it’s rarely stress-free. Depending on how long and how regularly you breastfed, the quantity of milk your body is still producing will vary. Here are six things to keep in mind as you navigate the weaning process. \r\n\r\nYou may not be as ready as you think\r\n\r\nMany mothers experience some level of regret or emotional guilt when they stop breastfeeding, particularly if weaning was premature or for reasons they weren’t ready for. Returning to work without pumping, buckling to the pressures of others, or pushing their child too soon developmentally are all examples of reasons mom can later regret the transition. Once you stop producing milk, the process cannot be reversed, so make sure the weaning is ideally happening at a time that works in the physical and emotional favor of both you and baby. If that isn’t possible, understand that bonding and maternal love are not solely dependent on the factors of nursing. \r\n\r\nYour baby may not be ready\r\n\r\nBeing the source of such valuable nutrients and emotional bonding for your baby is something hard to let go of. It makes it even harder when your child doesn’t want to wean. There are many no-cry solution books to transition through this process. No one knows your child better than you do, so trust your instincts. Remember not to play the comparison game. What worked for your friend or your mother-in-law with their babies may not be the same thing that you and your baby need. Be flexible and consistent, and give yourself and child plenty of grace through the transition. \r\n\r\nIgnore most opinions\r\n\r\nPeople love to give new parents advice. Not all of it is bad; not all of it is good. Opinions on when to wean may come flying at you from every direction. Be polite, but firm, about weaning when it works best for you and your baby. Whether the duration is shorter or longer than what other people expect, keep the bottom line about what you discuss with your pediatrician and your partner. It’s your body and your baby. Don’t let the opinions of others weigh on you emotionally or physically. No one but you and your child are living with the changes. \r\n\r\nYou may feel sad, or crazy \r\n\r\nMothers are hardly prepared for the flood of emotions they experience during the weaning process. You may feel really, really sad. You may cry for absolutely no reason in the middle of the day. You may experience loss and loneliness as your scheduled cuddle time with baby dwindles. But don’t worry. You are not crazy. These emotions are natural. Think P.M.S. on steroid overdrive. Mood swings, baby blues, nesting bug; it can be difficult to think your way out sometimes. When you know what to expect, it can be easier to handle. Make sure you have someone safe to talk to, and if you are experiencing more severe depression or extreme conditions, talk to your doctor and\/or professional. Post-weaning depression and anxiety are real, but should pass with time. If you find your moods, stress, sense of loss deepening or getting worse, don’t isolate yourself. Seek help without delay.\r\n\r\nFrom Drying to Crying\r\n\r\nWhether you are ready to wean or not, when your milk finally does dry up, it can be a roller coaster. Ranging from bittersweet nostalgia to relief with freedom can occupy your days. Some mothers have their milk dry up before they are ready, some within a day, some go on leaking for several weeks after weaning. On one hand, your breastfeeding bond can be hard to move past, on the other, you can celebrate tossing aside your nursing bras and pads. Just remember that hormonal changes are playing a large part as well. The cycle of relief-guilt-relief is normal. During nursing, high levels of oxytocin surge, and the let-down of those levels as your production dries up can require some adjustment. \r\n\r\nKeep the Connection\r\n\r\nFocus on new ways to bond with your little one, and remember that weaning hardly means you’ve lost the cuddle time with your kiddo. Make a special point during the mornings or evenings to continue affectionate time together. The biggest factor in weaning regrets are mothers afraid of losing their connection time with their baby. Build in available moments to continue these important bonding opportunities with your children for years to come. Bedtime stories with snuggles, wake up hugs and mid-afternoon lap time are all great ways to keep those ties strong. Enjoy the blessings of the next stage and chapter."

       "title":"Best Bottles for Nursing Babies",
       "tipDescription":"If you’re in the market for baby bottles, you have particular needs if you’re a breastfeeding mom. You want to look for a bottle that mimics the motion, flow and feeling of breastfeeding to avoid “nipple confusion” – when baby uses a bottle-feeding technique on your breast, leading to a difficulty latching on. If you have to use a bottle in the first few weeks, while baby is still learning to breastfeed, use one that is as close to the real thing as possible. This will ensure a smooth transition between breast and bottle.\r\n\r\nHere are some of the top-rated bottles for breastfed babies.\r\n\r\nComotomo \r\n\r\nComotomo bottles are squeezable and soft, designed to mimic the feel and function of breastfeeding. At the beginning of feeding, you can gently squeeze the bottle to give baby a “let down” experience, similar to nursing. Comotomo bottles are made entirely of 100 % medical grade silicone, and are free of BPA, PVC or phthalate materials.\r\n\r\nA dual anti-colic vent system ensures that air goes in and only milk comes out, which can help reduce colic, burping, gas and spit up. Cleaning by hand is a snap, since the bottle has a super wide mouth and four pieces, including the lid. It’s also safe in the microwave, boiling water, dishwasher and sterilizer. The bottle is sturdy and virtually unbreakable.\r\n\r\nBaby can get every drop of milk without having to tip the bottle upside down, as with some other products. The silicone keeps pre-warmed milk warm for about half an hour, but the bottles do take a long time to heat up in a bottle warmer.\r\n\r\nWhile the egg shape is great for baby to handle and use, it also tips over easily while filling. Due to the soft silicone material, screwing on the collar over the nipple is more difficult than with other bottles. Measure marks are difficult to read on the bottle, though they are etched into the silicone, so they won't be washed or rubbed away over time.\r\n\r\nMimijumi\r\n\r\nThe naturally colored nipple on the Mimijumi bottle is soft and wide, and features graduated textures to mimic the feel of an actual breast. The bottle is angled for even milk flow and to copy baby’s position while nursing. The wide bottle and nipple make cleaning by hand easy, and the nonslip base prevents tipping and spilling.\r\n\r\nThe bottle is made of BPA-free, food grade silicone and plastic. The nipple is just one piece, rather than nipple and collar, which means less to clean. It also comes with a top that snaps on tightly to keep the nipple clean and prevent leaks while transporting.\r\n\r\nThe biggest disadvantage of these bottles is the price, which retails for about $29.\r\n\r\nTommee Tippee Closer to Nature Bottle\r\n\r\nThe Tommee Tippee Closer to Nature Bottle rates highly with moms due to its breast-like nipple, anti-colic valve, compact design, ease of cleaning and budget-friendly price.\r\n\r\nThe soft silicone nipple feels like skin and is designed to gently elongate and flex during feeding to mimic breastfeeding. The valve on the nipple eliminates excessive air flow, meaning baby gets more milk and less air.\r\n\r\nThe bottle is contoured and compact. It is easy for baby to hold and grip, and takes up little space. Volume marks are clearly labeled on the outside, and testers found very little leaking.\r\n\r\nThe bottle, which comes in polypropylene or glass, has four parts including a lid and is wide and easy to clean. The bottle and nipple are microwave and dishwasher safe.\r\n\r\nOne disadvantage is that the wide area just below the nipple can trap milk, making it necessary to turn the bottle almost completely upside down to get the last bit of milk out. Also, the vent is located on the side of the nipple and can sometimes get blocked by baby's mouth or little hands while feeding."

       "title":"Help! My Milk Hasn't Come In Yet",
       "tipDescription":"You’re three days post-partum, your days and nights are mixed up, and your formerly predictable world is completely turned upside down. And on top of everything, your milk hasn’t come in yet. What can you do to hold yourself together and make sure your baby is getting the nutrition he needs?\r\n\r\nFirst of all – even though it seems impossible to do – relax. Your milk will come in eventually, and your baby needs the colostrum that your body produces in the meantime. And the more relaxed you can be, the better your body will be at producing milk.\r\n\r\nWhat does it mean for your milk to “come in”? When your baby is first born, your breasts produce nutrient-rich colostrum, which is most often yellowish or clear. Even though the amount of colostrum is tiny, it will provide all of the nutrition and important antibodies your baby needs to stay well-nourished and healthy during those early days. You should nurse early and often (around the clock) when your baby is first born to help him get the hang of it and to make sure that your body is being properly stimulated to produce milk.\r\n\r\nBy about the third or fourth day postpartum, your breasts should begin producing regular breast milk. For some women, the process of the milk “coming in” is very dramatic but for others it is more gradual. You will know that your milk has come in when your breasts are significantly fuller, firmer, and heavier; and your nipples start leaking a whitish fluid. You may notice that your baby is nursing longer, because he’s getting better at it, and because there’s more for him to consume.\r\n\r\nIf you had a difficult delivery or a C-section, or if you have other health problems, your milk may take longer to come in – approximately four to five days, or even longer in some cases. However, if you get to four days postpartum and your milk still hasn’t come in, you should stay in close touch with your pediatrician to make sure that your little one is gaining weight properly.\r\n\r\nTo stimulate your milk production, make sure that you are nursing every two to three hours around the clock. Get as much rest as you possibly can, and drink plenty of fluids. Beyond that, you may want to rent a hospital-grade breast pump that you can use after each nursing session. The pump may give you the extra stimulation you need to begin producing milk.\r\n\r\nSome doctors may insist that you begin to supplement with formula if your milk hasn’t come in by about Day 5. However, if you are committed to breastfeeding and do not want to begin using formula, you should seek qualified help from a lactation consultant. A lactation consultant will help you make sure that your baby is positioned and latching properly and may also recommend stimulants to help your body with milk production. Your hospital or doctor may be able to recommend someone for you, or you may find local support through the La Leche League, which works in support of breastfeeding mothers.\r\n\r\nLast but not least, don’t let anyone try to steer you away from a path that feels right to you. Some mothers manage to hold out even though their milk is slow to come in; some mothers supplement with formula and continue to use it; and still others use formula as a bridge while their milk comes in, and then once they have milk they never use formula again. Be wary of anyone who tries to warn you of absolutes, such as, “If you give your baby formula, it will destroy your nursing relationship.” Your story is yours alone to write; you should let it unfold in the way that is best for you and your baby."

       "title":"Breastfeeding as Birth Control: The Lactational Amenorrhea Method",
       "tipDescription":"Are you looking for a natural, effective method of contraception while you are nursing your infant? If so, then you may be a good candidate for what is known as the lactational amenorrhea method of birth control, sometimes referred to as LAM. LAM works because the hormone known as prolactin that helps your body produce milk also works to suppress the release of fertility hormones. So if you are nursing an infant regularly, your body will naturally decrease its ability to release fertile eggs.\r\n\r\nLAM is considered a reliable birth control method if you are able to meet three conditions: 1) Your infant is six months old or younger; 2) You are nursing your baby round the clock, on demand; and 3) Your regular menstrual period has not yet returned (bleeding and spotting in the weeks after birth would not count toward this condition). If you can say “yes” to all three of these conditions, LAM can work for you with a less than two percent chance of your becoming pregnant. However, as soon as any of these three preconditions changes, LAM will become less effective.\r\n\r\nLAM is, by definition, a short-term method of birth control, given that it is used when infants are six months old or less. In order for LAM to be fully effective, you should nurse your baby exclusively and not rely on supplementing with formula. As soon as your baby reaches the age when she is ready to start eating cereals and other solid foods, she will most likely reduce the amount that she nurses, making LAM less effective. Additionally, when your baby begins sleeping for longer stretches – and eventually sleeping through the night – she will not be relying on you for round-the-clock nutrition. This will also interfere with the effectiveness of LAM.\r\n\r\nSome women are able to extend the amount of time they are able to rely on LAM by co-sleeping and continuing to nurse through the night even after the baby reaches six months. They also continue nursing the same amount and make solid foods an addition to, rather than a substitution for breastfeeding. By keeping their nursing activity high, some mothers are able to continue LAM for as long as 14 months.\r\n\r\nHowever, the most important precondition of LAM is “amenorrhea” – which refers to the lack of a menstrual period. Once you have passed through the first three months post-partum (and finished with the post-partum bleeding), your period may return any time. When you experience two consecutive days of bleeding and\/or spotting, you should assume that your menstrual cycle has restarted and LAM is no longer reliable.\r\n\r\nLAM is not recommended for mothers of infants who have metabolic disorders, or for mothers who are taking certain mood-altering medications. You should check with your doctor to be sure that LAM is right for you and your baby. Additionally, when your period returns, you should check with your doctor to find out which birth control methods are safe and effective if you want to continue nursing. (KellyMom has a good round-up here.)\r\n\r\nHowever, those moms who are able to use LAM during those early days with their babies say that it combines the best of both worlds: You can enjoy this special time with your baby and your partner - with the confidence that you are using your body’s natural method of family planning."

       "title":"Foremilk Hindmilk Imbalance",
       "tipDescription":"Breast milk is remarkable in the way that it provides nutrition to your baby. It contains just the right balance of carbohydrates, protein, and fat, as well as antibodies that help fight infections. The composition of your breast milk is designed to change as your baby nurses so that he gets just the right amount of calories and fat. However, sometimes a mom will have problems with what is known as a foremilk hindmilk imbalance. What this means is that she is making (or baby is getting) too much foremilk, the milk from the start of a feeding, and not enough hindmilk, the milk from the end of a feeding.\r\n\r\nWhat is foremilk and hindmilk?\r\n\r\nWhen you nurse your baby, you make only one type of breast milk. Even though milk is described as foremilk and hindmilk, your breasts do not actually produce two separate types of milk. \r\n\r\nWhen you aren’t nursing your baby, your body is constantly making and storing milk for future feedings. Milk is produced in the alveoli (milk making cells inside your breast). It then travels through your milk ducts where it is stored in the lactiferous sinuses (or milk sinuses). When the milk is made, the fatty portion of the milk sticks to the walls of the alveoli. If you’ve ever looked at pumped breast milk after it’s sat in the fridge for a while, you will see that it separates. The fat floats to the top and sticks to the sides of the bottle. This is similar to what happens inside your breasts.\r\n\r\nWhen your baby nurses, he will initially get foremilk from your breasts. This is because the milk that has collected in your milk sinuses is the lower-fat foremilk. As your baby nurses for a while, he will trigger a “let down.” This forceful milk ejection pushes the milk and the fat that is sticking to the walls of the alveoli out. The longer he nurses, the more he will empty out the stored up low fat milk and start forcing the fattier milk out of the alveoli.\r\n\r\nThe longer the time between feedings, the more foremilk will be stored away inside the milk sinuses. The fat sticking to the walls of the alveoli is still there but your baby won’t get as much of this fat because you will have so much foremilk in storage that any fat will become diluted in the milk. Emptying the breast will empty the foremilk that is stored and allow your baby to get more of the fattier hindmilk.\r\n\r\nWhy it is important to empty the first breast\r\n\r\nMoms are often advised to offer both breasts at every feeding or given a time limit on how long to nurse on each breast. They may be instructed to nurse for ten minutes on the first breast and to then offer the second breast for ten minutes. To make sure your baby gets enough of the fattier hindmilk, you should make sure you empty the first breast first. (See LLLI’s Finish the First Breast First) Don’t restrict your baby to nursing for a certain length of time. Let him nurse for as long as he wants to on just one side. If he pulls off the breast and still seems hungry, you can then offer the second breast.\r\n\r\nIf your baby is mainly getting low calorie foremilk during his feedings, he will be hungrier and want to nurse more often. Nursing more frequently may compound the problem because mom may develop an oversupply of breast milk. Having an oversupply will mean there will be more milk made –foremilk – that will be sitting in storage between feedings. When this happens, your baby may have a hard time emptying the breasts of the fattier hindmilk because he is getting too filled up with the lower fat foremilk. \r\n\r\nWhy does this matter? Aside from wanting to nurse more frequently, babies can have other problems when they don’t get enough hindmilk. Breast milk contains lactose, a type of sugar. Your baby’s small intestines produce lactase, an enzyme that digests lactose, but they only produces so much lactase. If your baby is getting a lot of foremilk, he is also getting a lot of lactose. This may be hard on his digestive system. When your baby drinks more hindmilk, he gets more fat, instead of so much lactose, making the milk easier to digest. \r\n\r\nSymptoms of foremilk hindmilk imbalance\r\n\r\nBabies who get too much foremilk may be fussier and have tummy aches. Symptoms include:\r\n\r\nFussiness Spitting up frequently Gassiness and discomfort Green frothy stools Diarrhea Diaper rash from acidic stools and diarrhea Frequent nursing \r\n\r\nCauses of foremilk hindmilk imbalance\r\n\r\nSwitch nursing (switching back and forth between breasts frequently)\r\nIf baby is hungry, mom may offer one breast and then the other. Because baby likely received mostly foremilk during this feeding, baby may get hungry again shortly after. If mom continues switching breasts back and forth to feed her baby instead of letting the baby empty one breast completely, her baby may end up getting a lot of foremilk at every feeding instead of a more balanced amount of foremilk and hindmilk.\r\n\r\nNot giving baby enough time to nurse\r\nBeing in a hurry or being impatient during a feeding can mean that baby doesn’t nurse long enough at the breast to get to the hindmilk. Baby should be allowed to nurse on one breast until he pulls off on his own or stops actively sucking and swallowing milk.\r\n\r\nOversupply\r\nAn oversupply can create an imbalance of foremilk and hindmilk. Block nursing (nursing on only one breast at a time for 2 to 3 hours) may help mom to reduce her oversupply. By doing this mom can make sure that baby is nursing on each breast long enough to remove the hindmilk."

       "title":"Breastfeeding and Guilt",
       "tipDescription":"by Jack Newman, MD, FRCPC \r\n\r\nOne of the most powerful arguments many health professionals, government agencies and formula company manufacturers make for not promoting and supporting breastfeeding is that we should \"not make the mother feel guilty for not breastfeeding\". Even some strong breastfeeding advocates are disarmed by this \"not making mothers feel guilty\" ploy. \r\n\r\nBecause, indeed, it is nothing more than a ploy. It is an argument which deflects attention from the lack of knowledge and understanding of most health professionals about breastfeeding. This allows them not to feel guilty for their ignorance of how to help women overcome difficulties with breastfeeding, which could have been overcome and usually which could have been prevented in the first place if mothers were not so undermined in their attempts to breastfeed. This argument also seems to allow formula companies and health professionals to pass out formula company literature and free samples of formula to pregnant women and new mothers without pangs of guilt, though it has been well demonstrated that this literature and the free samples decrease the rate and duration of breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nLet's look at real life. If a pregnant woman went to her physician and admitted she smoked a pack of cigarettes, is there not a strong chance that she would leave the office feeling guilty for endangering her developing baby? If she admitted to drinking a couple of beers every so often, is there not a strong chance that she would leave the office feeling guilty? If a mother admitted to sleeping in the same bed with her baby, would most physicians not make her feel guilty for this even though it is the best thing for her and the baby? If she went to the office with her one week old baby and told the physician that she was feeding her baby homogenized milk, what would be the reaction of her physician? Most would practically collapse and have a fit. And they would have no problem at all making that mother feel guilty for feeding her baby cow's milk, and then pressuring her to feed the baby formula. (Not pressuring her to breastfeed, it should be noted, because \"you wouldn't want to make a woman feel guilty for not breastfeeding\".) \r\n\r\nWhy such indulgence for formula? The reason of course, is that the formula companies have succeeded so brilliantly with their advertising to convince most of the world that formula feeding is just about as good as breastfeeding, and therefore there is no need to make such a big deal about women not breastfeeding. As a vice president of Nestle here in Toronto was quoted as saying \"Obviously, advertising works\". It is also a balm for the consciences of many health professionals who, themselves, did not breastfeed, or their wives did not breastfeed. \"I will not make women feel guilty for not breastfeeding, because I don't want to feel guilty for my child not being breastfed\". \r\n\r\nLet's look at this a little more closely. Formula is certainly theoretically more appropriate for babies than cow's milk. But, in fact, there are no clinical studies which show that there is any difference between babies fed cow's milk and those fed formula. Not one. Breastmilk, and breastfeeding, which is not the same as breastmilk feeding, has many more theoretical advantages over formula than formula has over cow's milk (or other animal milk). And we are just learning about many of these advantages. Almost every day there are more studies telling us about these theoretical advantages. But there is also a wealth of clinical data showing that, even in affluent societies, breastfed babies, and their mothers incidentally, are much better off than formula fed babies. They have fewer ear infections, fewer gut infections, a lesser chance of developing juvenile diabetes and many other illnesses. The mother has a lesser chance of developing breast and ovarian cancer, and is probably protected against osteoporosis. And these are just a few examples. \r\n\r\nSo how should we approach support for breastfeeding? All pregnant women and their families need to know the risks of formula feeding. All should be encouraged to breastfeed, and all should get the best support available for starting breastfeeding once the baby is born. Because all the good intentions in the world will not help a mother who has developed terribly sore nipples because of the baby's poor latch at the breast. Or a mother who has been told, almost always inappropriately, that she must stop breastfeeding because of some medication or illness in her or her baby. Or a mother whose supply has not built up properly because she was given wrong information. Make no mistake about it-health professionals' advice is often the single most common reason for mothers' failing at breastfeeding! \r\n\r\nIf mothers get the information about the risks of formula feeding and decide to formula feed, they will have made an informed decision. This information must not come from the formula companies themselves, as it often does. Their pamphlets give some advantages of breastfeeding and then go on to imply that their formula is almost, actually just as good. If mothers get the best help possible with breastfeeding, and find breastfeeding is not for them, they will get no grief from me. It is important to know that a woman can easily switch from breastfeeding to bottle feeding. In the first days or weeks-no big problem. But the same is not true for switching from bottle feeding to breastfeeding. It is often very difficult or impossible, though not always. \r\n\r\nFinally, who does feel guilty about breastfeeding? Not the women who make an informed choice to bottle feed. It is the woman who wanted to breastfeed, who tried, but was unable to breastfeed. In order to prevent women feeling guilty about not breastfeeding what is required is not avoiding promotion of breastfeeding, but promotion of breastfeeding coupled with good, knowledgeable and skillful support. This is not happening in most North American or European societies. \r\n\r\nThis article may be copied and distributed without further permission."

       "title":"Using Gentian Violet",
       "tipDescription":"by Jack Newman, MD, FRCPC\r\n\r\nGentian violet (1% solution in water) is an excellent treatment for Candida albicans. Candida albicans is a fungus which may cause an infection of skin and\/or mucous membranes (inside of mouth, for example) in both children and adults. In small children, this yeast may cause white patches in the mouth (thrush), or diaper rash. When the nursing mother has a Candidal infection of the nipple, she may experience severe nipple pain, as well as deep breast pain.\r\n\r\nNipple pain caused by Candida albicans\r\n\r\nThe pain caused by a Candidal infection is generally different from the pain caused by poor positioning and\/or ineffective suckling. The pain caused by a Candidal infection:\r\n\r\nis often burning in nature, rather than the sharp, stabbing or pinching pain associated with other causes. Burning pain may be due to other causes, however, and pain due to a Candidal infection does not necessarily burn. frequently lasts throughout the feeding, and occasionally continues after the feeding has ended. This is in contrast to the pain due to other causes which usually hurts most as feeding begins, and gradually improves as the baby nurses. may radiate into the mother's armpit or into her back. may cause no change in appearance of the mother's nipples or areolas, though there may be redness, or some scaling, or the skin of the areola may be smooth and shiny. not uncommonly will begin after a period of pain free nursing. This characteristic alone is reason enough to try treatment for Candida. However, milk blisters on the nipple also may cause nipple pain after a period of pain free nursing as may eczema or other skin condition. may be associated with recent use of antibiotics by the baby or mother, but not necessarily. may be quite severe, may or may not be itchy. may occur only in the breast. This pain is often described as \"shooting\", or \"burning\" in nature, and is often worse after the feeding is over. It is often said to be worse at night. At the same time, the breast appears or feels normal. This is not mastitis and there is no reason to treat with antibiotics. On the contrary, antibiotics may make the problem worse. \r\n\r\nPlease Note:\r\n\r\na) The baby does not have to have thrush in his mouth. b) A Candidal infection of the nipple may be combined with other causes of soreness.\r\n\r\nUsing Gentian Violet\r\n\r\nWe believe that gentian violet (combined with \"all purpose nipple ointment\", see Treatments for Problems handout #24) is the best treatment of nipple soreness due to Candida albicans for the breastfeeding mother. This is because it works almost always, and relief is rapid. It is messy, and will stain clothing (actually, it usually will wash out), but not skin. The baby's lips will turn purple, but the purple will disappear after a few days. Gentian violet is available without prescription but is not available at all pharmacies. Call around before going out to get it.\r\n\r\nAbout 10 ml (two teaspoons) of gentian violet is more than enough for an entire treatment. Many mothers prefer doing the treatment just before bed so that they can keep their nipples exposed and not worry about staining their clothing. The baby should be undressed to his diaper, and the mother should be uncovered from the waist up. Gentian violet is messy. Dip an clean ear swab (Q-tip) into the gentian violet. Put the purple end of the ear swab into the baby's mouth and let him suck on the swab for a few seconds. The gentian violet usually spreads around the mouth quickly. If it does not, paint the inside of the mouth to cover as much of the inside of the cheeks and tongue as possible. Put the baby to the breast. In this way, both the baby's mouth and your nipple are treated. If, at the end of the feeding, you have a baby with a purple mouth, and two purple nipples, there is nothing more to do. If only one nipple is purple, paint the other one with the ear swab and the gentian violet. In this way, the treatment is finished in one go. Repeat the treatment each day for three or four days (see handout Candida Protocol for how long to use gentian violet). There is often some relief within hours of the first treatment, and the pain is usually gone or virtually gone by the third day. If it is not, it is unlikely that Candida was the problem, though it seems Candida albicans is starting to show some resistance to gentian violet, as it already has to other antifungal agents. Of course, there may be more than one cause of nipple pain, but after three days the contribution to your pain caused by Candida albicans should be gone. However, if your pain is virtually gone after 3 or 4 days, but not completely, you can use gentian violet a few more days if necessary. All artificial nipples that the baby uses should be boiled daily during the treatment, or well covered with gentian violet. Consider stopping artificial nipples. There is no need to treat just because the baby has thrush in his mouth. The reason to treat is the mother's and\/or the baby's discomfort. Babies, however, do not commonly seem to be bothered by thrush. Uncommonly, babies who are treated with gentian violet develop sores in the mouth which may cause them to reject the breast. If this occurs, or if the baby is irritable while nursing, stop the gentian violet immediately, and contact the clinic. The sores clear up within 24 hours and the baby returns to feeding. \r\n\r\nIf the infection recurs, treatment can be repeated as above. But if the infection recurs a third time, a source of reinfection should be sought out. The source may be the mother who may be a carrier for the yeast (but may have no sign of infection elsewhere), or from artificial nipples the baby puts in his mouth. Treatment of the mother (usually with a medication other than gentian violet) at the same time as treatment is repeated for the nipples will usually eliminate reinfection.

       "title":"Blocked Ducts and Mastitis",
       "tipDescription":"Mastitis is a bacterial infection of the breast which usually occurs in breastfeeding mothers. However, it can occur even in women who are not breastfeeding or pregnant, and can even occur in small babies. Nobody knows exactly why some women get mastitis and others do not. Bacteria may gain access to the breast through a crack or sore in the nipple, but women without sore nipples also get mastitis.\r\n\r\nMastitis needs to be differentiated from a plugged or blocked duct, because the latter does not need to be treated with antibiotics, whereas mastitis often, but not always, does require treatment with antibiotics. A plugged duct presents as a painful, swollen, firm mass in the breast, often with overlying reddening of the skin, similar to mastitis, though not usually as intense. Mastitis, though, is usually associated with fever and more intense pain and redness of the breast. As you can imagine, it is not always easy to differentiate a mild mastitis from a severe blocked duct. A blocked duct can lead to mastitis.\r\n\r\nIn order to make a diagnosis of mastitis, there must be an area of hardness, pain, redness and swelling in the breast. The absence of such an area in the breast means that the mother does not have mastitis. Flu-like symptoms or fever alone are not enough to make the diagnosis of mastitis. Shooting pains in the breast without an area of hardness are not mastitis. These are more likely caused by a yeast infection and thus should not be treated with antibiotics.\r\n\r\nAs with almost all breastfeeding problems, a poor latch, and thus, poor draining of the breast sets up the situation where mastitis can occur.\r\n\r\nBlocked Ducts\r\n\r\nBlocked ducts will almost always resolve spontaneously within 24 to 48 hours after onset. During the time the block is present, the baby may be fussy when nursing on that side, as milk flow may be slower than usual. Blocked ducts can be made to resolve more quickly by:\r\n\r\nContinuing breastfeeding on the affected side. Draining the affected area better. One way of doing this is to position the baby so his chin \"points\" to the area of hardness. Thus, if the blocked duct is in the outside, lower area of your breast (about 4 o'clock), the football position would be best. Using breast compression while the baby is feeding (Handout #15 Breast Compression). Heat on the affected area (hot water bottle) also helps. The mother trying to rest. (Not always easy, but take the baby into bed with you). Sometimes a blocked duct is associated with a small blister on the end of the nipple. If you have this, you can open the blister with a sterile needle and squeezing out the toothpaste material in the duct (not always possible). This gives relief of nipple pain and may result in the blocked duct immediately resolving. Come to the clinic if you cannot open the blister yourself. If a blocked duct has not settled within 48 hours (unusual), therapeutic ultrasound often works. This can be arranged at a neighbourhood physiotherapy office or sports medicine clinic. Many ultrasound therapists are not aware of this use of ultrasound. The dose of ultrasound is:\r\n\r\n2 watts\/cm2, continuous, for five minutes to the affected area, once daily for up to two doses.\r\n\r\nIf two treatments on two days do not work, there is no point in continuing with ultrasound. Get the blocked duct evaluated at the clinic or by your physician. Usually, however, if ultrasound is going to work, one treatment does the trick. Ultrasound also seems to prevent recurrent blocked duct which always occurs in the same place. Lecithin, one capsule (1200 mg) three or four times a day also seems to help prevent recurrent blocked ducts, at least for some mothers.\r\n\r\nMastitis:\r\n\r\nThe following is my approach to dealing with mastitis.\r\n\r\nIf the mother has symptoms for more than 24 hours, she should start antibiotics. If the mother has symptoms for less than 24 hours, I will prescribe an antibiotic, but suggest the mother wait before starting the medicine. If, over the next 8-12 hours, her symptoms are worsening (more pain, spreading of the redness, enlargement of the hardened area), then the mother should start the antibiotics. If, 24 hours later, the mother has not worsened, but not improved, she should start the antibiotics. However, if symptoms are starting to decrease, there is no need to start the antibiotics. The symptoms usually continue to resolve and will have disappeared over the next 2 to 5 days. Fever will usually be gone within 24 hours, the pain within 24-48 hours, the breast hardness within the next couple of day. The redness may remain for a week or longer.\r\n\r\nOnce improvement begins, on or off antibiotics, it should continue. If you get worse, or symptoms do not continue to improve over 24 or 48 hours, call the clinic.\r\n\r\nRemember:\r\n\r\nContinue breastfeeding, unless it is just too painful to do so. If you cannot continue breastfeeding, express your milk as best you can in the meantime, and restart breastfeeding as soon as you can. Continuing breastfeeding helps mastitis to resolve more rapidly. There is no danger to the baby. Heat (hot water bottle) applied to the affected area helps fight off the infection. Rest helps fight off infection. Fever helps fight off infection. Treat fever if you feel bad, not just because you have it. Take acetaminophen, ibuprofen or other medication for pain as you need it. You will feel better and there is no danger to the baby, who gets only a tiny amount. Note: Amoxycillin, plain penicillin and other antibiotics are often ineffective for mastitis. If you need an antibiotic, you need one which is effective against Staphylococcus aureus. Effective for this bug are: cephalexin, cefaclor, cloxacillin, flucloxacillin, amoxycillin-clavulinic acid, clindamycin and ciprofloxacin. The last two are effective for mothers allergic to penicillin. You can and should continue breastfeeding with all these medications.\r\n\r\nAbscess: Abscess occasionally complicates mastitis. You do not have to stop breastfeeding, not even on the affected side. Usually, the abscess needs to be drained surgically, but you should continue breastfeeding. Contact the clinic.\r\n\r\nHandout #22 Blocked Ducts and Mastitis. January 1998\r\n\r\nJack Newman, MD, FRCPC is a pediatrician, a graduate of the University of Toronto medical school.

       "title":"Mastitis Symptoms and Treatment",
       "tipDescription":"Mastitis, or an infection of the breast, occurs most often with lactating mothers within the first six months of breastfeeding. Breast infections can occur in non-lactating women, but is usually a sign of a more serious disease that requires immediate medical attention.\r\n\r\nMastitis can occur at any point while a woman is breastfeeding, but happens more frequently during the early post-partum period. This is when the mother and child are establishing their breastfeeding routine. Mastitis is believed to be caused by germs entering the breast through the nipple. \r\n\r\nMastitis: Signs and Symptoms\r\n\r\nMastitis usually appears suddenly and only affects one breast. It is extremely rare for mastitis to be in both breasts at the same time. The signs and symptoms of mastitis often come on very rapidly. A noticeable hard lump, swelling, tenderness or an area that is warm to the touch may present. Mastitis may also leave you feeling like you have the flu-body aches, fever and fatigue.\r\n\r\nThe belief used to be that breast milk from the infected breast was bad and that the baby would become ill if they drank it. This has been proven untrue. Women are encouraged to nurse from their affected breast. \r\n\r\nMastitis: Treatments\r\n\r\nThere are steps you can take at home to help you treat mastitis before it progresses. You should offer the affected breast first and change positions to ensure the breast is fully emptying. If nursing is too unbearable, pumping breast milk from the affected side should be performed.\r\n\r\nTaking good care of yourself is an important step in treating mastitis. Research has indicated that stress and poor self-care contributes to mastitis. This is another reason to sleep when your baby sleeps. You should call your doctor if you notice no improvement from self treatment in 24 hours or if you are starting to become feverish. Your doctor will probably want you to come into the office for an evaluation.\r\n\r\nMany times, doctors will prescribe an oral antibiotic series to assist your body in fighting off the infection. If you’re given an antibiotic, it’s important for you to take the medicine as directed for the prescribed amount of time. Even if you start to feel better, it is important for you to continue out the series.\r\n\r\nIf left untreated, mastitis can lead to a breast abscess. A breast abscess is an accumulation of pus inside the breast. Treatment for a breast abscess may require a doctor to make an incision into the breast to drain the infection. \r\n\r\nMastitis Prevention:\r\n\r\nYou may be able to prevent mastitis with the following tips Do not allow your breasts to engorge. Offer frequent feedings. If unable to feed, pump. Only wear good supporting bras. Under wires should be avoided. Get plenty of rest, but avoid sleeping on your stomach. Wash your hands before and after breastfeeding. Ensure your baby is latching on to the breast properly. Apply lanolin in between feedings to your nipples to help prevent cracks. Know what to look for so that you can treat mastitis early at the first sign of trouble."

       "title":"Breast Implants and Breastfeeding",
       "tipDescription":"Breastfeeding is a popular choice for many new mothers. Breast milk provides excellent nutritional and health benefits for infants, and breastfeeding can be a profound bonding experience between baby and mom. Another popular choice for women these days is breast implants (also known as breast augmentation) – and since some women opt for breast implants during their childbearing years, there are questions about whether or not a woman can breastfeed after she’s had implants. \r\n\r\nBreast Implants and Breastfeeding – Can It Be Done?\r\n\r\nMany women with breast implants are able to breastfeed – but this can depend on how the implant surgery was performed. If the surgical incision was made under the fold of the breast or through the armpit, there shouldn’t be any serious problem with breastfeeding, since implants can then be inserted without damaging milk ducts or nerves. If, however, the incision is made on or around the areola (the dark part of the breast surrounding the nipple), it increases the likelihood that milk ducts and nerves will be severed, which could limit milk production and impact a woman’s ability to breastfeed. Placement of breast implants can also play a part in breastfeeding, as pressure from the implants can damage milk ducts and nerves. Whatever the surgical procedure, if a woman with breast implants plans to breastfeed, she should work with a doctor or lactation consultant to monitor her milk production for several months, to make sure the baby is getting enough milk. If you’re thinking of having breast implants and also plan to have a child in the future and possibly breastfeed, be sure to let your plastic surgeon know this, so that special care will be taken to try not to damage milk ducts or major nerves. \r\n\r\nBreast Implants and Breastfeeding – Potential Problems\r\n\r\nWomen with breast implants sometimes don’t produce enough milk to adequately nourish a baby through breastfeeding. Even though a baby may seem to be nursing normally, in some cases an insufficient amount of milk is made. This can be due to surgically severed milk ducts (more likely when surgical incisions are made around the nipple), pressure from the implants pushing against and closing ducts, or implants taking up space in the breast where milk would be stored. If nerves were damaged in surgery, this could affect the release of hormones (prolactin and oxytocin) that trigger the production and release of breast milk. Implants can also block a normal flow of breast milk. The added pressure of breasts that are full of milk can be painful, which might cause a woman to stop trying to breastfeed. Some women with implants are so worried about potential complications they don’t even try to breastfeed. \r\n\r\nBreast Implants and Breastfeeding – A Risk to Baby?\r\n\r\nAnxiety that their breast implants could somehow be harmful to a nursing baby keeps some women from considering breastfeeding. This stems in large part from the fear that chemical material inside the implant could somehow leak into the breast milk and then get into the baby’s system – this issue was of particular concern to women with silicone implants, but studies have shown that it is highly unlikely that silicone molecules, even if leaked from an implant, could get into milk ducts. Furthermore, most implants are currently made from a saline (salt) solution; not only is it doubtful that the saline could somehow pass into milk ducts, if it somehow did, ingested saline would not be harmful to an infant’s health. Even though there’s no real health risk to your baby, if you’re thinking of getting breast implants, you might want to consider waiting until after you’ve already had and breastfed children."

       "title":"Breastfeeding - Handling Criticism",
       "tipDescription":"Feelings about how to parent seem to shift with every generation. A new way of parenting, sometimes called attachment parenting, has emerged and it challenges many of the rigid teachings of our mother's generation. Although breastfeeding is on the rise now, women are still dealing with the repercussions of previous generations. Not too long ago mainstream women did not breastfeed at all and the ones that did were taught to follow strict schedules.\r\n\r\nSome thought of breastfeeding as primitive. Formula was touted as being equal to or superior to breast milk. Only recently, has the fact that \"breast is best\" been acknowledged. Other women were in the workforce. They may have felt that breastfeeding was not an option for them. They did not have the modern breast pump available to them. The medical community may not have encouraged breastfeeding at the time. It is not hard to imagine. After all, even with all the knowledge about the benefits of breastfeeding there are still many health professionals today that are uneducated and unsupportive of breastfeeding. With all the challenges in the way of breastfeeding, it is understandable why many women of yesterday did not choose to breastfeed. \r\n\r\nBreastfeeding has come a long way but still many of the old thinking still carries on. Women are more educated on the subject; however, even with the many books and other information available, people are often most influenced by their immediate family and friends. Having the support of friends and family can boost the chances of having a successful breastfeeding experience. On the other hand, having to deal with criticism and misinformation from the people you are close to can sabotage a new mom trying to breastfeed. \r\n\r\nThere are many ways to deal with the negativity of others. One of the best things you can do is to try to understand why the person feels the way they do. Is it because they were taught differently about breastfeeding? Were they indoctrinated with the ideas that breastfeeding is primitive or inferior? Or is it that they feel breasts are a sexual object? Maybe they have never seen someone breastfeed and it makes them uncomfortable. This is the case with a lot of people. Once breastfeeding in public becomes more commonplace, perhaps, this will become less of a problem. Whatever the case, finding out the root of the person's issues with breastfeeding may help to resolve the tension. \r\n\r\nHere are some things you can do to deal with criticism. \r\n\r\nBe positive: It is hard for someone to argue with a happy, positive person. If you are excited and enthusiastic about breastfeeding it can be contagious\r\n\r\nTry to educate them: Find information on the benefits of breastfeeding to mom and baby and share this with them. You don't have to \"push this down their throat\". Just be enthusiastic about your decision to breastfeed and share with them why you decided to. \r\n\r\nBe sympathetic: A lot of times women are defensive because breastfeeding did not work out for them. If you sit and talk with any woman that really wanted to breastfeed, you can hear the sadness in her story. Try to be sympathetic and non-judgmental. Don't say things like \"you could have or should have\". Share your experience, be positive, and let them know you care.\r\n\r\nTry not to get angry: Breastfeeding conversations can get very heated. Getting angry with someone is not likely to change her feelings. It will just make you and her upset. If you don't feel like you can talk about breastfeeding with this person change the subject or avoid talking about it. \r\n\r\nUse your doctor as your advocate: Sometimes the best thing you can do is tell someone that this is what your doctor recommends. What you think means very little to some people but a doctor's word carries weight. \r\n\r\nDon't be sarcastic or insulting: Belittling someone is likely to make someone defensive. It is not a good approach to winning someone over. You may turn an opportunity to educate someone into a personal attack. \r\n\r\nStand your ground: Do not let someone else decide how you are going to parent. If they are uncomfortable then they will have to come to terms with it. You do not have to change the way you parent to suit someone else. \r\n\r\nIf nothing is working then you may just let the person know that you do not want to discuss the issue with them any more. Hopefully, it doesn't come to this."

It makes it harder to keep track of how old your breast milk is.\r\n\r\nHow can you tell if breast milk is spoiled? \r\n\r\nIf you are properly storing your milk you should not have a problem with spoiled milk. Breast milk will separate. The fat will rise to the top. This is normal it does not mean your milk is spoiled. You may sometimes have thinner looking or blue colored milk, this is still okay. Another concern comes along when moms or caregivers smell breast milk. Sometimes breastmilk that is frozen or stored in the refrigerator will smell soapy or have a strange taste to it. This does not mean it is spoiled. Before you toss out perfectly good breast milk consider how it was stored. If it was refrigerated after pumping and stored properly, it probably doesn't need to be tossed. However, if you are concerned, if the milk smells rancid or sour go ahead and toss it.\r\n\r\nWhat size portions should you store breast milk in? \r\n\r\nIt is better if you store breast milk in small portions (around 3-4 oz per freezer bag or storage container). Once frozen milk is thawed you can not refreeze it. If you store breast milk in 8-10 oz portions you may end up wasting breast milk if your baby does not drink it within 24 hours."

       "title":"More and More Breastfeeding Myths",
       "tipDescription":"by Jack Newman, MD, FRCPC \r\n\r\n1. Nursing mothers cannot breastfeed if they have had X-rays. \r\n\r\nNot true! Regular X-rays such as a chest X-ray or dental X-rays do not affect the milk or the baby and the mother may nurse without concern. Mammograms are harder to read when the mother is lactating, but can be done and the mother should not stop breastfeeding just to get this done. There are other ways of investigating a breast lump. Newer imaging methods such as CT scan and MRI scans are of no concern, even if contrast is used. \r\n\r\nAnd special X-rays using contrast media? As long as no radioactive isotope is used there is no concern and the mother should not stop even for one feed. Herein are included studies such as intravenous pyelogram, lymphangiogram, venogram, arteriogram, myelogram etc. What about studies using radioactive nucleotides (bone scans, lung scans, etc.)? The baby will get a little radioactive nucleotide. However, as we often do these very same tests on children, even small babies, and the potential loss of benefits if the mother stops breastfeeding are considerable, the mother should continue breastfeeding. The exception is the thyroid scan. This test must be avoided in breastfeeding mothers. There are many ways of evaluating the thyroid, and only very occasionally does a thyroid scan truly have to be done. Check first before taking the radioactive iodine-the test can wait until you know for sure. In many cases where the scan must be done, it can be put off for several months. \r\n\r\n2. Breastfeeding mothers' milk can \"dry up\" just like that. \r\n\r\nNot true! Or if this can occur, it must be a rare occurrence. Aside from day to day and morning to evening variations, milk production does not change suddenly. There are changes which occur which may make it seem as if milk production is suddenly much less: \r\n\r\nAn increase in the needs of the baby, the so called growth spurt. If this is the reason for the seemingly insufficient milk, a few days of more frequent nursing will bring things back to normal. Try compressing the breast with your hand to help the baby get milk (Handout #15, Breast Compression). \r\n\r\nA change in the baby's behaviour. At about 5-6 weeks of age, more or less, babies who would fall asleep at the breast when the flow of milk slowed down, tend to start pulling at the breast or crying when the milk flow slows. The milk has not dried up, but the baby has changed. Try compressing the breast with your hand to help the baby get more milk. \r\n\r\nThe mother's breasts do not seem full or are soft. It is normal after a few weeks for the mother no longer to have engorgement, or even fullness of the breasts. As long as the baby is drinking at the breast, do not be concerned (see handout 4 Is my baby getting enough milk). \r\n\r\nThe baby breastfeeds less well. This is often due to the baby being given bottles or pacifiers and thus learning an inappropriate way of breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nThe birth control pill may decrease your milk supply. Think about stopping the pill or changing to a progesterone only pill. Or use other methods. \r\n\r\nIf the baby truly seems not to be getting enough, get help, but do not introduce a bottle which will only make things worse. If absolutely necessary, the baby can be supplemented, using a lactation aid which will not interfere with breastfeeding. However, lots can be done before giving supplements. Get help. Try compressing the breast with your hand to help the baby get milk (Handout #15, Breast Compression). \r\n\r\n3. Physicians know a lot about breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nNot true! Obviously, there are exceptions. However, very few physicians trained in North America or Western Europe learned anything at all about breastfeeding in medical school. Even fewer learned about the practical aspects of helping mothers start breastfeeding and helping them maintain breastfeeding. After medical school, most of the information physicians get regarding infant feeding comes from formula company representatives or advertisements. \r\n\r\n4. Pediatricians, at least, know a lot about breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nNot true! Obviously, there are exceptions. However, in their post medical school training (residency), most pediatricians learned nothing formally about breastfeeding, and what they picked up in passing was often wrong. To many trainees in pediatrics, breastfeeding is seen as an \"obstacle to the good medical care\" of hospitalized babies. \r\n\r\n5. Formula company literature and free formula samples do not influence whether or how long a mother breastfeeds. \r\n\r\nReally? So why do the formula companies work so hard to make sure that new mothers are given these samples, their company's samples? Are these samples and the literature given out to encourage breastfeeding? Is the cost of the samples and booklets taken on by formula companies so that mothers will be encouraged to breastfeed longer? The companies often argue that, if the mother does give formula, they want the mother to use their brand. In competing with each other, the formula companies also compete with breastfeeding. Did you believe that argument when the cigarette companies used it? \r\n\r\n6. Breastmilk given with formula may cause problems for the baby. \r\n\r\nNot true! Most breastfeeding mothers do not need to use formula and when problems arise that seem to require artificial milk, often the problems can be resolved without resorting to formula. However, when the baby may require formula, there is no reason that breastmilk and formula cannot be given together. \r\n\r\n7. Babies who are breastfed on demand are likely to be \"colicky\". \r\n\r\nNot true! \"Colicky\" breastfed babies often gain weight very quickly and sometimes are feeding frequently. However, many are colicky not because they are feeding frequently, but because they do not take the high fat milk as well as they should. Typically, the baby drinks very well for the first few minutes, then nibbles or sleeps. When the baby is offered the other side, he will drink well again for a short while and then nibble or sleep. The baby will fill up with relatively low fat milk and thus feed frequently. The taking in of mostly low fat milk may also result in gas, crying and explosive watery bowel movements. The mother can urge the baby to breastfeed longer on the first side, and thus get more higher fat milk, by compressing the breast once the baby no longer actually swallows at the breast. (Handouts #3 Colic in the breastfed baby and #15 Breast Compression). \r\n\r\n8. Mothers who receive immunizations (tetanus, rubella, hepatitis B, hepatitis A, etc.) should stop breastfeeding for 24 hours (3 days, 2 weeks). \r\n\r\nNot true! Why shouldn't they? There is no risk for the baby, and he may even benefit. The rare exception is the baby who has an immune deficiency. In that case the mother should not receive an immunization with a weakened live virus (e.g. oral, but not injectable polio, or measles, mumps, rubella) even if the baby is being fed artificially. \r\n\r\n9. There is no such thing as nipple confusion. \r\n\r\nNot true! A baby who is only bottle fed for the first two weeks of life, for example, will usually refuse to take the breast, even if the mother has an abundant supply. A baby who has had only the breast for 3 or 4 months is unlikely to take the bottle. Some babies prefer the right or left breast to the other. Bottle fed babies often prefer one artificial nipple to another. So there is such a thing as preferring one nipple to another. The only question is how quickly it can occur. Given the right set of circumstances, the preference can occur after one or two bottles. The baby having difficulties latching on may never have had an artificial nipple, but the introduction of an artificial nipple rarely improves the situation, and often makes it much worse. Note that many who say there is no such thing as nipple confusion also advise the mother to start a bottle early so that the baby will not refuse it. \r\n\r\nHandout #14.

       "title":"Comfort Measures for Mom and Baby While Weaning",
       "tipDescription":"As a breastfeeding mother, you’ve shared a very intense physical and emotional experience with your baby. When it finally comes time for weaning, you will probably go through a range of emotions from sadness to relief. For some moms this can be an especially rough period. You’ll feel better if you make yourself as comfortable as possible during this process while giving your little one lots of extra TLC.\r\n\r\nComfort for Mom\r\n\r\nIdeally, you’ve been working toward weaning with a gradual decrease in nursing over several weeks or months. That will make weaning easier on you and your body. But if for some reason you need to stop more suddenly than you had anticipated, don’t panic. You will make it through, even if it means a day or two of discomfort.\r\n\r\nWhen you wean, the main symptom you experience will be fullness and even engorgement of your breasts. You can relieve the fullness by expressing a little bit of milk here and there either by hand or with a breast pump. Express just enough to make yourself more comfortable, and don’t worry about sending your body a signal that the baby is still nursing. When your little one’s nursing decreases dramatically, your milk production will scale back accordingly.\r\n\r\nIf you’re still feeling uncomfortable, you can try taking a warm shower and massaging your breasts to let a little more milk out. This can be particularly helpful if you have a plugged duct or a specific area that is hard and swollen. Massage the area gently to relieve the discomfort. You may also take a pain reliever such as ibuprofen to relieve the pain.\r\n\r\nAnother helpful technique to reduce engorgement is to put cabbage leaf compresses on your breasts. It sounds strange, but many moms swear they work to relieve engorgement. Take a large (washed) green cabbage leaf and place it over your breast, under your bra. The colder it is, the better it will feel. Keep it on until it wilts and then use more cabbage leaves as needed.\r\n\r\nWhile you’re going through this process, wear a comfortable and supportive bra. And don’t forget to keep a fresh supply of nursing pads on hand. You’ll probably be leaking a bit more than usual and you don’t want to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable with wet spots on your shirt or bra. Be prepared to change the pads frequently to keep the moisture away from your skin.\r\n\r\nYou may get the advice to “bind” your breasts or wrap them tightly to help the milk dry up. This practice has largely been discredited because it can lead to plugged ducts or breast infections. If you do have some kind of breast infection like mastitis, you will feel shooting pains in your breast along with flu-like symptoms, including fever, chills, and fatigue. If you have symptoms of a breast infection, get plenty of rest and see your doctor. You may need to go on antibiotics to clear it up.\r\n\r\nHelping Your Little One Make the Transition\r\n\r\nFortunately for your baby, there won’t be physical discomforts associated with weaning, but he or she will miss the closeness. Plan to spend plenty of extra time snuggling, reading, and playing with your little one. If you are weaning a small baby, make sure that he is comfortable with the transition to a bottle. Also try to stick to all of his comforting, predictable routines throughout the day, especially at naptime and bedtime.\r\n\r\nIf you are weaning an older baby or toddler who knows how to ask for nursing, you may need to be more strategic. Create some appealing distractions for the times when you would normally be nursing (special games, books, or even treats like cookies depending on the time of day and your child’s diet). You should also use the words that you use for nursing (“Mommy’s milk,” etc.) to remind her that “Mommy’s milk is all gone” or “We’re not going to have Mommy’s milk anymore, but you’re a big girl and big girls get to eat ice cream.”\r\n\r\nWeaning can be a bittersweet time for both of you, and it’s OK to shed a few sentimental tears as you go through this transition. But once the process is through, it’s time to look forward to the new and exciting things you will be able to enjoy with your not-so-little one. Best of all, you’ll have a healthy, independent child who has benefited from your commitment to breastfeeding."

       "title":"Allergies and What You Eat While Breastfeeding",
       "tipDescription":"Whether because of misunderstandings, cultural differences or even old wives tales, your breastfeeding diet may feel like a long list of \"don'ts.\" A lot of what you should and should not eat will depend on how your baby reacts during or after feedings. The foods you eat do affect the texture, makeup, consistency, quality, taste, and even the smell of your breast milk. Additionally, it's possible to pass things to your baby through breast milk that won't affect you, but will affect them.\r\n\r\nIs your baby allergic to your breast milk?\r\n\r\nThe short answer is \"maybe,\" but unlikely. For example, an allergic reaction the baby has to your breast milk is usually a reaction to a protein in cow's milk that you consumed. While it is possible for a baby to be intolerant of breast milk, it is usually the mother's diet that is to blame, meaning there's an easy solution. Talk to your doctor to learn about the foods that you eat that baby may react to, and how to detect allergies.\r\n\r\nWas it something you ate?\r\n\r\nAllergies are more common than ever, with one in five children developing a food allergy before the age of 20, according to experts. This is in part because some children are exposed to allergy-causing foods while still too young. A food allergy stems from the body mistaking the elements of the food as foreign bodies and an allergic response is triggered. The good news is, if you are exclusively breastfeeding, you can control what foods your baby is exposed to. This means there is less exposure to allergens. Less exposure to allergens means a lower likelihood of allergies later on.\r\n\r\nIf you suspect a specific food is causing an allergic reaction in your baby, stop eating that food for 10 days and see if the reaction clears up. If it's an allergy to something in your breast milk, it will start to improve after 5-7 days. After 10 days, add the food back into your diet and see if the reaction occurs again.\r\n\r\nCulprit Foods and Baby Allergies\r\n\r\nThere isn't one \"list of foods all moms should avoid\" because what bothers one person may not bother another. It's the same with babies. This is especially true cross-culturally where some women in other countries eat very spicy foods that don't bother them or their babies, for example. In general, you should be able to eat what you want - unless you see a reaction from your baby."

       "title":"Common Breastfeeding Mistakes",
       "tipDescription":"More women are deciding to breastfeed their babies in hopes of providing them with all the health benefits that come from breast milk, but also to form a special bond with their babies. Most women go into breastfeeding with a positive attitude and put an effort into doing things right. Still, with all the effort, breastfeeding doesn’t always go according to plan. If the breastfeeding relationship doesn’t get off to a good start, it can present challenges that are sometimes difficult to overcome. By being prepared and being aware of common breastfeeding mistakes, a woman can hopefully avoid these mistakes and get off to a good start with breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nHere are some common breastfeeding mistakes:\r\n\r\nWatching the clock when breastfeeding: When breastfeeding a new baby, women often try to schedule their feedings for every three to four hours or watch the clock when they feed their babies. Instead of watching the clock, follow your baby’s cues. If she is hungry feed her, even if you just nursed her. Try to nurse long enough to empty your breasts but don’t get obsessed with the clock. Some babies are very efficient nursers and can empty your breasts lickity-split while other babies are slow and take much longer to get the job done. Follow your baby’s lead. If she still seems hungry, keep nursing. If she pulls away from the breast before your clock says it is time for her to be done, she may be full. Try nursing her again a little later or wait until she gets a little fussy to try again.\r\n\r\nMistaking normal fussing for hunger: Babies fuss for different reasons. Just because your baby is crying doesn’t mean she is hungry. Watch her cues to see if she is indicating hunger or something else. If she is rooting around, she might be hungry. If she is not rooting or you just fed her, there could be another reason she is crying. Some babies cry a lot during certain times of the day. Crying doesn’t equal hunger. Try checking her diaper, swaddling, or rocking her to see if that helps. As long as your baby is having plenty of wet diapers (around 6-8 a day), she is most likely getting enough milk. \r\n\r\nOffering baby formula too soon: Not all moms want to exclusively breastfeed. However, offering formula too quickly can sabotage your breastfeeding relationship. It is best to wait until your baby has gotten the hang of breastfeeding and until your milk supply is well established before offering formula or bottles to your baby. Sometimes a mom will give her baby formula because she thinks she is not getting enough milk. Babies will often suck down a bottle of formula – even if they just nursed – simply because they like sucking. Sucking feels good so babies may suck on a bottle whether they are hungry or not. If your baby takes a bottle of formula after breastfeeding, this does not necessarily indicate that she is hungry. It could be she just liked the soothing feeling she got from sucking on the bottle’s nipple.\r\n\r\nWaiting too long to get help: If your baby is not gaining weight, is not latching on to your breast well, or if breastfeeding is constantly painful, you might want to talk to a lactation consultant. Lactation consultants are trained professionals that can help you with your breastfeeding relationship. The first few weeks of breastfeeding are critical. If you are having problems talking to a lactation consultant may help. Another source of breastfeeding advice and support is the La Leche League."

       "title":"To Wean or Not to Wean? That is the Question",
       "tipDescription":"This could either feel like a beacon of light on the horizon or a sad reality of life: At some point, every mother stops breastfeeding. Some start thinking about stopping not long after they've begun. Others find that nursing becomes such an important and rewarding part of their lives that they feel like they could go on forever. Usually a mother (or, regrettably, another outside adult force) leads the charge to stop nursing, but sometimes it's the kid who makes the final decision to quit.\r\n\r\nNo matter how it comes about, no matter if it feels traumatic or natural for the parties involved, the truth is this: Weaning happens.\r\n\r\nAnthropologist Katherine Dettwyler, Ph.D, famously studied the average weaning ages of primates, humans' closest ancestors. She concluded that if left to their own devices, human children would likely wean at or around the same ages as apes, orangutans, and gorillas -- somewhere between two and a half and seven years. Even though she knows that Western social mores don't allow for many seven-year-old nurslings, Dr. Dettwyler still advocates for the nutritional, emotional, and developmental benefits of extended breastfeeding, a stance that has elevated her to hero status in the attachment parenting world.\r\n\r\n\"You have to consider the needs of the individual mother and look at the individual baby,\" Dr. Dettwyler says. \"That said, weaning at six months is not biologically normal. When babies come out of the birth canal, they don't know they are Americans,\" she says. \"They don't know that our culture expects them to stop breastfeeding at a specific time. All they know is that they are little baby primates. Their bodies are going to expect to nurse for two and a half to seven years, and to them that is normal.\"\r\n\r\nWhat seems normal for one baby might feel abnormal to another. Timea Szalay is a lactation educator and mother of four from Innisfil, Ontario. While she knows that many children continue to nurse happily well into their preschool years, she's come to the conclusion that most kiddies decide to call it quits long before they're old enough to ride two-wheelers.\r\n\r\n\"This isn't the case for every child,\" Szalay says, \"but I generally find that babies wean themselves sometime between 18 months and three years.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Szalay started having children, she decided that she was going to let her babies determine the way they wanted to be breastfed. \"From the start, I knew that I was going to let my children lead the way,\" she says. \"I was going to let them decide on their own when they wanted to nurse, how much they wanted to nurse, and to have their own way of weaning themselves.\" Her first children, a set of twins, abruptly stopped nursing at four-and-a-half months. Her third child stopped taking breastmilk when he was less than nine months old. Both weanings took Szalay by surprise.\r\n\r\n\"My twins just quit one day, and there was nothing I could do to get them to start again,\" she recalls. \"I was terribly sad about it, but I was also so overwhelmed by being a new mother that I didn't know what else to do. My third stopped taking the breast when I had pneumonia and I had a high fever. I was very sick and on antibiotics. I don't know if that's why he stopped nursing, but for some reason he just stopped one day. I often think I could've stopped taking the antibiotics, that maybe that would've brought him back, but eventually I told myself he stopped when he wanted to.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Szalay gave birth to her fourth child, she took the same child-led approach to breastfeeding as she had with the other three. This time things are different. Her youngest son, now three-and-a-half, is still nursing about three times a day and once at night. Both mama and son are happy with the arrangement.\r\n\r\n\"Because the twins quitting so young was a disappointment, when my third went to five months I said, 'Wow. This is all bonus,\"' Szalay says. \"I viewed every extra day as a benefit for me and my child. Now, with this son I continue to say every day is a bonus. I'm very happy with the decision I've made to keep nursing him as long as he wants. Maybe it's partly because he's my last child and it's a way of me hanging on to this part of my life, but when he wants to quit, I'll support his decision.\"\r\n\r\nBefore I became a mother, I had no idea that weaning could be a controversial topic, touchy enough that many breastfeeding guides offer only the slimmest advice on how to make it safely through this big transition. (A few books do offer good weaning advice, though, and board-certified lactation consultants can also a great source of information.)\r\n\r\nIn the not-so-distant past, many doctors and mainstream parenting gurus argued that after the first year or so, breastmilk provided little nutritional benefit for children. In recent years, however, most medical experts have changed their tune, and new research has discovered that breast milk continues to boost the immune systems of kids well into the second year of life, maybe even further.\r\n\r\nThat's great news, but plenty of mamas who've nursed their babies past the traditional definition of \"babyhood\" have gotten their share of grief from friends and family who encourage them to stop nursing the minute the sight of a growing (or talking or walking) child at its mother's breast starts to make them feel uneasy.\r\n\r\nSzalay tells her clients to ignore the critics and keep on nursing for as long as they -- and their babies -- want. \"Breastmilk is the best food for babies,\" she says. \"No matter if you nurse for just a week or for years, breastfeeding provides emotional benefit as well as protection and immunity for your child. No matter what the age of your child, your breastmilk is made specifically for him. Every day your child gets milk from your breast is an amazing bonus for both of you.\""

       "title":"Breastfeeding: How to Handle Common Concerns",
       "tipDescription":"When you continue breastfeeding at home in the weeks after your baby’s birth, you're giving your newborn a great health advantage. For maximum benefit, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends nursing for a year. But many moms give up breastfeeding before their babies are six months old. Here are some suggestions for how to cope with common concerns and help you feel confident with breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nAsk for help.\r\n\r\nIt is important that a breastfeeding mother is well-rested and relaxed in order to keep up her milk supply, so even if she isn't accustomed to asking for help, she will need to do that once baby arrives. Since no one can help a mom with the actual breastfeeding, family and friends can assist in other ways. They can lend a helping hand by bringing you the baby when it is time for a feeding. They can also help with cleanup and some household routines while mom is nursing the baby.\r\n\r\nReduce anxiety and stress.\r\n\r\nPostpartum anxiety is as common as postpartum depression. It can be difficult to maintain a good milk supply or take proper care of yourself and your baby if you have anxiety or depression. The lack of sleep that occurs in those first weeks and months of motherhood before baby is sleeping through the night or on a set schedule can contribute to postpartum stress. Here are some tips to help you relax and get more rest:\r\n\r\nFind ways to relax (e.g., soothing music, white noise, and getting into a nursing position that’s comfortable). Keep in mind that the American Academy of Pediatrics says you can’t sleep with your baby. However, nursing in a side-lying position can be relaxing. If a mother is very fatigued, it would likely be dangerous for her to nurse while sitting up.\r\n\r\nIf you nurse in a side-lying position and are concerned that you may doze off and roll onto baby while you sleep, you can bend the upper knee and raise it over your body, then place the bent knee onto the mattress—the bent knee is like a stopper that prevents you from rolling over.\r\n\r\nTake a warm bath, which helps release oxytocin and encourage milk flow.\r\n\r\nMassage your breasts gently during nursing or apply a heat pad on the breast before nursing your baby.\r\n\r\nTune into your baby's behavior.\r\n\r\nYou’ll know if your baby is getting enough breast milk by observing his\/her behavior. After you nurse, burp and change your infant, check for these signs:\r\n\r\nQuiet time is good – This occurs after your baby has been breastfeeding effectively (which happens when there is a good balance of your milk flow and your baby’s feeding skills). He or she comes off the breast after feeding and looks around, hiccups, or falls into a deep sleep—all signs of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nKeep a close watch on baby’s weight.\r\n\r\nIs your baby crying often—perhaps acting distressed despite frequent nursing? You can typically relieve distress by burping or rocking the baby to relieve gas, and checking for a dirty diaper.\r\n\r\nSome weight loss after birth and the first weeks of breastfeeding is normal for a newborn. It is important to stay in touch with your doctor for follow-up to track your baby’s early growth and progress. Dramatic weight loss in a newborn or failure to gain weight after the first few weeks of breastfeeding can sometimes be a cause for concern, so communication with your doctor is important.\r\n\r\nAdjust the feeding schedule, as needed.\r\n\r\nThe golden rule of breastfeeding, according to La Leche League is that the more a baby nurses effectively, the more milk there will be. Really understanding this rule will lead to a contented baby who is receiving enough nourishment from breast milk.\r\n\r\nOf course, a breastfeeding mom needs to be diligent (feeding 8 times a day in a 24-hour period) in the crucial first few weeks. After the baby gets back to birth weight or gains weight at an appropriate pace, the eight feedings can be spread out accordingly.\r\n\r\nEvery new mother's schedule may be different—it all depends on how long the baby sleeps at night. If someone’s baby sleeps for a five-hour stretch, the nursing mom just has to fit in those eight feeds before she goes to bed at night.\r\n\r\nBy six weeks, the baby starts making the hormones melatonin and cortisol—this usually helps the child sleep better at night. Mom may not need to nurse as frequently at that point. However, if your infant is not feeding well (losing weight, not getting enough nourishment), then wake him or her up at regular intervals to nurse. Double-check that he\/she is latching on properly, and consult with a lactation consultant if you need help.\r\n\r\nRelieve\/prevent breast engorgement.\r\n\r\nBreast engorgement occurs when milk and blood build up, resulting in hard and painful breasts. (You likely experienced engorgement when your milk came in during those first days following your baby’s birth.) It could also happen for other reasons later on, such as:\r\n\r\nIf you leave your baby with a sitter or family member for an extended period of time, interrupting the usual breastfeeding schedule, then your breasts may get too full of milk.\r\n\r\nIf you're prone to anxiety or stress, this can interfere with the “let-down” reflex, resulting in a feeling of fullness and pain in the breast.\r\n\r\nHere are ways to prevent and\/or relieve engorgement:\r\n\r\nNurse often. (8 times a day)\r\n\r\nUse a breast pump. A mom can pump any time she wants after breastfeeding. If your baby only wanted to nurse on one side, for example, you can pump the other side – not to empty it, but to soften it, and prevent engorgement.\r\n\r\nBe prepared. If you know you’ll be away too long from your baby to nurse on schedule, be sure to pack a breast pump and empty bottles, and a portable case with an ice pack to store the pumped milk.\r\n\r\nGet enough rest, good nutrition, and fluid intake.\r\n\r\nDon’t stop breastfeeding abruptly!"

But, just because we breast pump does not mean that we cannot bond. Some of us experience a great bond while we feed this sweet baby, staring into those brand new beautiful eyes, talking softly, and cuddling closely to feel the warmth and smell of that newborn baby. It just takes some creativity, oh, and also the incredible love that you have for this child.\r\n\r\nSome believe that you cannot experience the bond without the skin to skin contact, and yet many of us have created ways to experience this also. Bath time is a perfect time to get the skin to skin contact with baby. Each evening before bed, my husband would hand the baby to me and the two of us would coo and smile at one another in the wonderful warm water.\r\n\r\nAdvocates of exclusive breastfeeding often forget the physical and emotional obstacles that may be caused during the birth of a baby. When a mom is experiencing some of these problems, exclusive breastfeeding often poses an additional problem to an already problematic situation. This in turn causes a distance between mom ad baby, as opposed to creating a bond. If mom is experiencing problems, other feeding alternatives, especially breast pumping, may assist in the bonding experience."

       "title":"Breastfeeding a Toddler - Why on Earth?",
       "tipDescription":"Because more and more women are now breastfeeding their babies, more and more are also finding that they enjoy breastfeeding enough to want to continue longer than the usual few months they initially thought they would do it. UNICEF has long encouraged breastfeeding for two years and longer, and the American Academy of Pediatrics is now on record as encouraging mothers to nurse at least one year and as long after as both mother and baby desire. Breastfeeding to 3 and 4 years of age has been common in much of the world until recently, and breastfeeding toddlers is still common in many societies.\r\n\r\nWhy should breastfeeding continue past six months?\r\n\r\nBecause mothers and babies often enjoy breastfeeding a lot. Why stop an enjoyable relationship?\r\n\r\nBut it is said that breastmilk has no value after six months. \r\n\r\nPerhaps this is said, but it is wrong. That anyone can say such a thing only shows how ignorant so many people in our society are about breastfeeding. Breastmilk is, after all, milk. Even after six months, it still contains protein, fat, and other nutritionally important and appropriate elements which babies and children need. Breastmilk still contains immunologic factors which help protect the baby. In fact, some immune factors in breastmilk which protect the baby against infection are present in greater amounts in the second year of life than in the first. This is, of course as it should be, since children older than a year are generally exposed to more infection. Breastmilk still contains factors which help the immune system to mature, and which help the brain, gut, and other organs to develop and mature.\r\n\r\nIt has been well shown that children in daycare who are still breastfeeding have far fewer and less severe infections than the children who are not breastfeeding. The mother thus loses less work time if she continues nursing her baby once she is back at her paid work.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting that formula company marketing pushes the use of formula (a rather imperfect copy of the real thing) for a year, yet implies that breastmilk (from which the imperfect copy is copied) is only worthwhile for 6 months. Too many health professionals have taken up the refrain.\r\n\r\nI have heard that the immunologic factors prevent the baby from developing his own immunity if I breastfeed past six months. \r\n\r\nThis is untrue; in fact, this is absurd. It is unbelievable how so many people in our society twist around the advantages of breastfeeding and turn them into disadvantages. We give babies immunizations so that they are able to defend themselves against the real infection. Breastmilk also allows the baby to be fight off infections. When the baby fights off these infections, he becomes immune. Naturally.\r\n\r\nBut I want my baby to become independent. \r\n\r\nAnd breastfeeding makes the toddler dependent? Don't believe it. The child who breastfeeds until he weans himself (usually from 2 to 4 years), is generally more independent, and, perhaps more importantly, more secure in his independence. He has received comfort and security from the breast, until he is ready to make the step himself to stop. And when he makes that step himself, he knows he has achieved something, he knows he has moved ahead. It is a milestone in his life.\r\n\r\nOften we push children to become \"independent\" too quickly. To sleep alone too soon, to wean from the breast too soon, to do without their parents too soon, to do everything too soon. Don't push and the child will become independent soon enough. What's the rush? Soon they will be leaving home. You want them to leave home at 14?\r\n\r\nOf course, breastfeeding can, in some situations, be used to foster an overdependent relationship. But so can food and toilet training. The problem is not the breastfeeding. This is another issue.\r\n\r\nWhat else?\r\n\r\nPossibly the most important aspect of nursing a toddler is not the nutritional or immunologic benefits, important as they are. I believe the most important aspect of nursing a toddler is the special relationship between child and mother. Breastfeeding is a life affirming act of love. This continues when the baby becomes a toddler. Anyone without prejudices, who has ever observed an older baby or toddler nursing can testify that there is something almost magical, something special, something far beyond food going on. A nursing toddler will sometimes spontaneously break into laughter for no obvious reason. His delight in the breast goes far beyond a source of food. And if the mother allows herself, breastfeeding becomes a source of delight for her as well, far beyond the pleasure of providing food. Of course, it's not always great, but what is? But when it is, it makes it all so worthwhile.\r\n\r\nAnd if the child does become ill or does get hurt (and they do as they meet other children and become more daring), what easier way to comfort the child than breastfeeding? I remember nights in the emergency department when mothers would walk their ill, non nursing babies or toddlers up and down the halls trying, often unsuccessfully, to console them, while the nursing mothers were sitting quietly with their comforted, if not necessarily happy, babies at the breast. The mother comforts the sick child with breastfeeding, and the child comforts the mother by breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nHandout #21. Toddler nursing.

       "title":"Is It OK To Diet While You are Breastfeeding?",
       "tipDescription":"Even if your weight gain was completely healthy while you were pregnant, you’ve probably been looking forward to the time post-pregnancy when you shed some of your extra baby weight. But breastfeeding moms need to be extra cautious about how – and when – they lose the weight so as not to interfere with the quality of their milk, and ultimately, their babies’ nutritional needs.\r\n\r\nA general rule of thumb is to wait at least two months post-partum before beginning any kind of diet. During those first two months, your hormones are all over the map trying to readjust themselves after pregnancy, you’re probably not getting much sleep, and your body doesn’t need any more big changes. Besides, you will most likely lose weight quickly in those first few weeks without even trying.\r\n\r\nAfter the first two months, and once you have your doctor’s OK, it’s probably safe to start trying to lose the rest of your baby weight. The key is to go slowly and stay healthy.\r\n\r\nGoing slowly is the best way to protect your health and your milk supply. You don’t want to have a sudden drop in the number of calories you consume, for instance, and you don’t want to drop more than a pound per week. Both of these could hurt your body’s ability to make enough milk for your baby, and it may rob your body of precious nutrients.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, you want to keep your diet healthy. Don’t go on any sort of “fad” diet that involves only liquids, severely restricted carbohydrates, large quantities of any one food, or diet medications. Instead, stick to the same healthy diet that you followed while you were pregnant: plenty of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, beans and legumes, and low-fat dairy products. Also, don’t cut out all fat: Your baby needs the fat in your milk for healthy brain development, especially the “good” fats (monounsaturated fats and polyunsaturated fats) such as those found in olive oil, nuts, and seeds.\r\n\r\nIf you are counting calories, your diet should not dip below 1800 calories per day. In fact, if your baby is exclusively breastfeeding, you can count on your body using an extra 300 to 500 calories per day to create the milk. That amount is equivalent to the extra calories that you needed when you were pregnant – about two healthy snacks per day above what you would normally be eating.\r\n\r\nExercise is another important part of healthy weight loss. As long as you have your doctor’s approval, you can add moderate exercise to your daily routine so that you burn more calories and build muscle. But again, start up an exercise program slowly and take it easy. Don’t run yourself into the ground with exhaustion. And make sure you keep yourself well-hydrated. It’s always good to drink lots of water while you’re breastfeeding, and if you add on an exercise program, you’ll need to drink more to compensate.\r\n\r\nAbove all, remember to celebrate your body and be proud of it for the amazing things it has done and continues to do. Your body will almost certainly be different for having given birth to a child – wider hips, softer tummy – but it is no doubt beautiful. (Most breastfeeding moms are also proud of their breasts that are fuller and rounder than ever.) So don’t keep focusing only on what the scale says in the morning. Make sure you look at your whole body in the mirror and appreciate it for who you are and for the amazing gifts that you have given to your baby."

       "title":"4 Breastfeeding Tips for New Moms",
       "tipDescription":"Many moms want to breastfeed as part of the nurturing process that comes after pregnancy and birth. For many new mothers, once the baby arrives, reality hits, and some nursing mothers may experience a few unexpected setbacks when they begin breastfeeding. However, it’s possible to overcome challenges with know-how and patience. The first few weeks of breastfeeding are crucial to get you and your baby on the way to a great nursing experience.\r\n\r\nTips for successful breastfeeding:\r\n\r\n1. Encourage your baby to latch on well. \r\n\r\nIf breastfeeding hurts after the first 30 seconds, your baby likely has a “latch problem.” Here are some ways to address problems with latching on:\r\n\r\nCheck your positioning and that of your baby. Start out by sitting up in your bed or a comfortable chair, and be sure you position your infant properly. For example, you can use the “cradle hold” —your newborn should be lying on his side, facing you with his knees pulled close to your body. Read more in helpful books, such as The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding; I Make Milk. What’s Your Superpower? - The Ultimate Guide to Success in Breastfeeding; or The Breastfeeding Book: Everything You Need to Know about Nursing Your Child from Birth through Weaning. You might also call your ob-gyn for guidance or connect with a lactation consultant in your area via the La Leche League (www.llli.org).\r\n\r\nOnce you and your infant are positioned correctly, urge your baby to open his mouth by moving him toward and then away from your nipple. Repeat this forward and back movement—until he opens his mouth widely. Gently pull your infant onto your breast\/nipple, ensuring his chin is first.\r\n\r\nIf your nipple looks bright pink or red after nursing, and it continues for more than two weeks, you may have a latch problem. You can soothe sore nipples with Vitamin E oil, and contact a breastfeeding support center where a lactation consultant can give you tips for how to help baby latch on so you can avoid this problem.\r\n\r\n2. Don’t starve yourself! Eat small portions frequently.\r\n\r\n“It’s not what the mom eats or drinks that keeps up your milk supply, it’s what happens to your body when you go into starvation mode—it affects the thyroid and insulin levels,” says Jennifer Ritchie, International Board Certified Lactation Consultant and founder of Milkalicious. According to Ms. Ritchie, a healthy snack is popcorn. It’s a good carbohydrate, which stabilizes blood sugar and is a fun food that doesn’t put on the pounds.\r\n\r\n3. Prepare to breastfeed at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nIf your baby sleeps through feeding times, he (or she) will lose weight and energy! A nursing mother will probably be feeding her newborn up to eight times a day. This can continue until the child is eight months old and eating three regular meals a day. Don’t stress out! Your baby will become so efficient at nursing that he may drain both breasts in just a few minutes!\r\n\r\nResearch shows that more than 80 percent of mothers in the United States begin breastfeeding in the hospital, and that only 12 percent of babies get breast milk by the time they are six months old. This drop happens mainly because moms quit nursing because of breastfeeding difficulties or worries that the baby may not be getting enough breast milk.\r\n\r\n4. Nap when your baby does--to keep making enough milk.\r\n\r\nSleep is essential for good milk supply. If the nursing mom can’t sleep, she might have post-partum anxiety – and she should talk to her ob-gyn. (It’s as common as post-partum depression!) Lack of adequate rest lowers your milk production. In order to catch up on any sleep you are losing at night, most experts recommend you take a nap during the day when your baby does. For those first few months, it is okay if your house is a bit messier or you don't get through your \"to do\" list. Your body has a job to do, and it needs rest in order to do it!\r\n\r\nWith guidance and moral support from breastfeeding experts who have been there, more babies could get a healthy start in life by being breastfed."

       "title":"What is Colostrum?",
       "tipDescription":"Colostrum is a special form of milk that your body produces for the first few days of your baby's life. It contains lots of nutrients and energy that your baby needs initially for his first few days of rapid adjustment to life outside the womb. Colostrum has a huge number of health benefits for your new baby.\r\n\r\nColostrum Production\r\n\r\nThe milk ducts in your breasts start producing colostrum at about the 16th week of pregnancy. Colostrum is produced in a low quantity, and your body makes just enough of it to last through the first few days of the baby's life. The baby's stomach is extremely small at birth, and colostrum is produced at about a teaspoon-sized amount for this reason.\r\n\r\nColostrum Benefits\r\n\r\nProvides antibodies for the baby's immune system Provides antibodies to protect the baby's throat and digestive system Provides carbohydrates for energy Provides protein for growth Works as a laxative to help baby with the first stool (meconium) Clears bilirubin from the body and prevents jaundice Provides leukocytes to protect against viruses and bacteria Provides tremendous benefits to premature babies (growth, immune system, etc.) \r\n\r\nFrom Colostrum to Breast Milk\r\n\r\nColostrum lasts for three to five days after the baby is born. There's no set time for when your body will suddenly switch from colostrum to milk, but it typically happens within this window. Another nice thing about colostrum is that it makes the baby feel good. By the second or third day, your baby will associate this feeling with breastfeeding and will be eager to latch on every time he is hungry."

       "title":"Beginners guide to breastfeeding",
       "tipDescription":"While breastfeeding comes naturally to your baby, it is a skill that you will find improves with practice. Once you've mastered it you'll find that breastfeeding is the easiest and most satisfying way to feed your baby. \r\n\r\nIt shouldn’t hurt, but you may feel some tenderness when your baby latches on in the first few weeks.\r\n\r\nBreast milk\r\n\r\nThe colostrum that your breasts naturally produce for your baby after the birth is the best food you can give him. This first milk contains everything your baby needs to thrive and grow and is also rich in the antibodies that will protect her from infection and help to make her immune system strong.\r\n\r\nBreast milk is the only food your baby needs for the first six months of life because, as he grows, the natural composition of your breast milk will change to meet his needs.\r\n\r\nThe fat content of your milk increases as your baby feeds, so that as your breast empties the fat content is higher than at the beginning of the feed. Allowing your baby to empty the breast before offering the other one means that he will get both the lower fat milk at the beginning of the feed and the nutrient-rich higher fat milk at the end.\r\n\r\nBabies who are feeding well will get the right intake and the right type of milk to satisfy their needs. \r\n\r\n\r\nResponsive feeding\r\n\r\nKnown as baby-led feeding, or \"responsive feeding\", this is all about creating a close, loving bond between you and your baby by responding to his needs before he starts to cry. When your baby cries he releases stress hormones which will make him feel unhappy and insecure. Being able to recognise the signs that indicate your baby is hungry and then acting on them before he becomes upset will help him to feel safe and secure. \r\n\r\nFeed your baby whenever he seems hungry – this could be as much about 10 to 12 times in 24 hours at first. By responding to his needs you will not only satisfy her hunger but will also be offering him reassurance and comfort.\r\n\r\nThis will help to build up your milk supply and prevent your breasts from becoming uncomfortably full. Feeds can take any time from 10 to 40 minutes so make sure you are comfortable and that your baby is ‘latched on’ properly. \r\n\r\nFind out more about responsive feeding\r\n\r\nBenefits for your baby\r\n\r\nFeeding your baby frequently will help to ensure that your baby will:\r\n\r\n• get all the milk he needs\r\n\r\n• cry less and be happier\r\n\r\n• gain weight as expected\r\n\r\nBenefits for you\r\n\r\nResponding to your baby's feeding cues will:\r\n\r\n• ensure your breasts produce enough milk for your baby's needs\r\n\r\n• prevent your breasts from becoming too full, which will help to avoid mastitis\r\n\r\nWhat you will need\r\n\r\nYou will need at least two nursing bras Later, if you want to express milk, a breast pump may be useful along with other feeding equipment.\r\n\r\nVitamin D\r\n\r\nA 10mcg vitamin D supplement is recommended during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Your baby may also need a supplement. Your midwife or health visitor will be able to advise you.\r\n\r\nPositioning\r\n\r\nHowever you hold your baby to feed him, it’s important to find a position which is comfortable for you and which allows your baby to latch on easily. \r\n\r\nMake sure your back and arms are well supported with pillows. You may find it helps to raise your feet a little, perhaps by putting them on a low stool or even resting them on a pile of books on the floor. Position your baby close to you, holding him so that he doesn’t need to turn his head to reach the breast. His mouth and nose should be facing your nipple and his body should be facing your front. Your shoulders, arms and wrists should be relaxed and most of your baby’s weight should be on your body. \r\n\r\nLatching on\r\n\r\nEncourage your baby to open his mouth really wide by lightly brushing his lips with your nipple. Once his mouth is open wide his head should be slightly tilted back so that his nose is at the level of your nipple. \r\n\r\nDraw him onto the breast, chin first, so that at least half an inch of the breast below the base of the nipple goes in to his mouth. This way your nipple will be pointing towards the roof of your baby’s mouth. \r\n\r\nIf you feel comfortable the latch-on is good. \r\n\r\nIf you experience any discomfort or your milk doesn’t begin to flow, or if you feel pain when your milk does begin to flow, detach your baby gently from the breast by inserting a clean little finger in to his mouth between his jaw and tongue to release the suction, and then try again.\r\n\r\nPoints to check:\r\n\r\nYour baby’s chin should be touching your breast and his nose should be clear. His bottom lip should be curled back. You should be able to see more areola (the dark area around the nipple) above his top lip than below his bottom one. \r\n\r\nYour baby will suck without swallowing when he is first offered the breast. This sucking encourages your breast to let down milk. \r\n\r\nOnce the milk starts to flow, you will see your baby’s jaw working all the way back to his ear and his swallowing pattern will change from short sucks to long deep sucks with pauses. \r\n\r\nIf your baby is correctly latched on you will feel a deep pulling sensation in your breast. \r\n\r\nIf your nipples become sore\r\n\r\nThe first thing to check is your baby's positioning to make sure he is latching on correctly. Gently rub a few drops of your milk on your nipples after a feed and let them air dry. A small amount of purified lanolin may help with healing. Wear a cotton maternity bra and change your breast pads at each feed. If your nipples remain sore, become cracked or bleed, ask your midwife or breastfeeding counsellor for advice. \r\n\r\n\r\nFeeding cues\r\n\r\nKeeping your baby close to you during the day and night will help you learn to recognise his feeding cues. \r\n\r\nThese will include:\r\n\r\n• rooting\r\n\r\n• wriggling \r\n\r\n• waving\r\n\r\n• sucking fists\r\n\r\n• moving his eyes\r\n\r\n• making murmuring noises\r\n\r\nYour baby will benefit from responsive feeding however you choose to feed him.\r\n\r\nBottle feeding\r\n\r\nFormula milk doesn’t offer the same degree of protection as breast milk, but it does contains all the nutrients, vitamins and minerals your baby needs for the first six months. Your baby should be bottle fed in a semi-upright position with the teat almost horizontal and filled with milk. \r\n\r\nMaking up feeds\r\n\r\nAlways wash your hands before you start and make sure that all the feeding equipment is sterilised. It is very important to follow the instructions on the pack as too much, or too little formula could be harmful to your baby. Always use the scoop provided. Place the correct amount of boiled tap water in the bottle (the water must be used within 30 minutes of being boiled so that its temperature is no less than 70°C ), then add the formula. Cool the bottle in cold water before checking the temperature. \r\n\r\nNHS guidelines recommend making up each feed as it’s required and that any formula which is leftover after a feed should be thrown away after one hour. Made-up formula that’s been at room temperature for more than two hours should also be thrown away. If you do have to make up a feed in advance, store it in the fridge for no longer than 24 hours. \r\n\r\nFurther help and advice\r\n\r\nIf you have any questions or concerns about breastfeeding there is a lot of help and support available.\r\n\r\nAsk your midwife, health visitor or GP. Call the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212. Join a local support drop in centre, Children’s Centre or group."

       "title":"How to breastfeed",
       "tipDescription":"It can take sometime for you and your newborn to learn how to breastfeed but once you have mastered the skill it can be a wonderful, satisfying experience and the physical closeness you share will help you to bond with your baby.\r\n\r\nThe first feed\r\n\r\nHolding your baby skin-to-skin straight after the birth not only is calming for your baby but it also helps you to get started with breastfeeding. In the first hour or so after the birth, your baby is likley to be alert and ready for a feed and if you hold her close to your breast now, she will instinctively 'root', or nuzzle, for your nipple in search of food.\r\n\r\nYour midwife can help your baby to latch on for this first feed, which may be brief, just minutes, or last for half an hour, or more. At this early stage, you and your baby are simply getting used to the process, so just relax and go with it.\r\n\r\nYour baby may be quite sleepy after the birth or perhaps fretful - but putting her to the breast to suck whenever she shows signs of wanting a feed will stimulate your milk production and will also give your baby the comfort and protection she needs.\r\n\r\nHow to breastfeed - a step by step guide\r\n\r\nEach feed can take anything from 10 to 40 minutes, sometimes longer, so it’s important to be as relaxed as possible before you begin and to make sure your baby is ‘latched on’ properly.\r\n\r\nGetting your baby properly ‘latched on’ will help to make breastfeeding comfortable for you and means your baby will feed efficiently.\r\n\r\n· To get started, hold your baby close to you with her her chest against your chest, her nose opposite the nipple (so that she can reach the breast easily) and her head, shoulders and body in a straight horizontal line. \r\n\r\n· Your baby needs to take a good mouthful of breast tissue – both the nipple and the surrounding dark area called the areola. With her head tilted back, bring her chin and bottom lip to the breast (rather than move your breast towards your baby) and get her to brush your nipple with her lips, which stimulates her to open her mouth wide.\r\n\r\n· Once her mouth is open really wide, bring her to the breast quickly. Aim her bottom lip below the base of your nipple. Her chin should be touching your breast and her nose should be free so that she can breathe easily. Your baby is properly latched on when her mouth is wide open and she has a big mouthful of breast.\r\n\r\n· She should settle into a feeding rhythm quite quickly, starting with short sucks, then taking longer, deeper sucks with pauses and you will notice her jaw moving as she feeds.\r\n\r\n· If you feel any discomfort at the start of a feed, your baby may not be latched on properly. Gently insert your clean little finger into the corner of her mouth to break her suction and then remove her from the breast and try to latch her on again. Never pull her off the breast without first breaking the suction, as this will be painful for you.\r\n\r\n· If your baby starts to wiggle or seems agitated mid-feed, she may need winding. Break the suction and gently wind her, then carry on with the feed.\r\n\r\n\r\nBreastfeeding tips\r\n\r\nHere are some guidelines for successful breastfeeding:\r\n\r\n· Get comfortable at the start of a feed. Sit in a firm chair that supports your back and arms, using cushions for extra support. Being relaxed will help your milk supply, which will increase the speed at which your baby feeds.\r\n\r\n· You may be in one spot for a while, so have everything you need close to hand, perhaps the TV remote, a magazine or book and the phone.\r\n\r\n· Stay well hydrated when breastfeeding to keep your energy levels up. Keep a glass of water by your side during a feed so you can take sips whenever you are feeling thirsty.\r\n\r\n· Allow your baby to feed for as long as she wishes on one breast before changing to the other breast if she’s still hungry. Your baby will let you know when she’s finished a feed by either coming off the nipple or falling asleep. If she falls asleep near the start of a feed, stroke her cheek to rouse her and check if she wants to carry on feeding. Try to remember to start her next feed on the alternate breast. \r\n\r\n· As you get more practised at feeding, you can try different feeding positions and find one or two that suit you and your baby most. A classic cradle hold allows you to cradle your baby in your arms during a feed while you sit upright. After a Caesarean, you may find lying on your side with your baby lying alongside you easier at first as this avoids putting eight on your abdomen. A V-shaped feeding cushion that supports your baby during a feed also avoids putting pressure on your tummy. Or you can try the ‘rugby’ hold, with yoru baby’s body and legs tucked under your arm.\r\n\r\n· Babies have growth spurts, so your baby may feed more often during these until your milk supply increases to meet the bigger demand. \r\n\r\nIf you need help\r\n\r\nIf you encounter any difficulties don’t stop feeding, but ask your midwife or health visitor for help, or contact a breastfeeding counsellor or call the National Breastfeeding Helpline: 0300 100 0212."

       "tipDescription":"'Breast is best' is not simply a slogan to encourage mothers to breastfeed – it’s also a scientifically proven fact. \r\n\r\nGiving your baby breast milk really will be giving him the best possible start in life and breastfeeding has many benefits for you too.\r\n\r\nAlthough breastfeeding is a natural process, a little practice is needed in order to master it successfully. \r\n\r\nIf you experience minor difficulties at first don’t be tempted to give up – any problems can usually be overcome with the support of your midwife and health visitor. Once mastered, breastfeeding can be a wonderful, satisfying experience and the physical closeness you share will help you to bond with your baby.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that the first feed should be within one hour of birth and that you breastfeed exclusively for six months before introducing other food into your baby’s diet. \r\n\r\nBenefits for your baby\r\n\r\nResearch shows that breast milk contains antibodies that protect babies against infections such as gastroenteritis, respiratory illness, urinary and ear infections. \r\n\r\nIt is also known to reduce the risk of childhood diabetes and allergic conditions such as eczema and of cot death. \r\n\r\nBreast milk is especially important for the development of the nervous system in premature babies. \r\n\r\nIt also contains long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids, which play an important part in a baby’s brain development.\r\n\r\nBenefits for you\r\n\r\nBreastfeeding uses at least an extra 500 calories a day so it can help you get back into shape after the birth. Breastfeeding for at least six months significantly reduces the risk of pre-menopausal breast cancer, and can also protect you from osteoporosis, ovarian cancer and type 2 diabetes. \r\n\r\nBreast milk\r\n\r\nYour breast milk contains all the nutrients your baby needs, in the right quantities, for the first six months of his life. The milk is produced on a supply and demand basis – the more your baby demands the more your breasts supply.\r\n\r\nAfter the birth your breasts naturally produce a high protein liquid called colostrum. This first ‘milk’ is rich in the antibodies that protect your baby from infections and help to build a strong immune system. Colostrum is yellow in colour and very concentrated so your baby only needs a small amount – about a teaspoonful – at each feed.\r\n\r\nAfter three or four days, whether you are breastfeeding or not, the colostrum gradually becomes transitional milk – a mixture of colostrum and mature breast milk. \r\n\r\nYou may notice this change as a feeling of fullness in your breasts, which may make them heavy and uncomfortable – this is often described as ‘the milk coming in’. Any discomfort should only last for 24–48 hours. You can help yourself by feeding your baby frequently and by wearing a well-fitting nursing bra. \r\n\r\nTwo to three weeks later mature breast milk comes through. This is made up of 90% water, which is needed to keep your baby hydrated and the remaining 10% is made up of the carbohydrates, protein and fat and minerals required for growth and energy. The composition of the breast milk changes as your baby feeds with the fat content increasing as the milk is removed. \r\n\r\nFeeding on demand and allowing him to feed as long as he wants on one breast before changing to the other ensures that your baby get the right amount of milk to satisfy his needs. \r\n\r\nAs your baby grows the nutritional composition of your breast milk will change to meet his needs."

       "tipDescription":"Sore nipples\r\n\r\nCauses\r\n\r\nThe most common reason for sore nipples is incorrect positioning which means that your baby isn’t latched on properly so she is sucking on the nipples rather than the surrounding areola. \r\n\r\nSoreness can also occur if your baby is taken off the breast without the suction being broken first. Sometimes nipple pain is caused by thrush however, this is more common if your baby has had antibiotics.\r\n\r\nOther causes include:\r\n\r\nReattaching the bra while the nipples are still wet or wearing soggy breast pads Using too much soap which can dry the skin Developing a sensitivity to creams or sprays \r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nMake sure your baby is well attached; line up the nipple with your baby’s nose or top lip so she can reach the nipple easily. She should automatically tilt her head towards the breast and open her mouth wide. Make sure she takes in big mouthful of breast including the area around the nipple.\r\n\r\nTo detach her from the breast, gently put your clean little finger in the side of her mouth to break the suction. \r\n\r\nIf you are having trouble you can get help and support from your midwife, health visitor, GP or breastfeeding volunteer. \r\n\r\nThey may be able to suggest a breastfeeding group in your area where you can get further support. Alternatively, contact the National Breastfeeding Helpline on 0300 100 0212 to speak to a trained volunteer.\r\n\r\nOther tips\r\n\r\nKeep nipples dry and expose them to the air as much as possible Regularly change your breast pads so they are fresh and dry Wear a cotton bra to let the air circulate Start each feed with the opposite breast to the one you finished with last time so that alternative breasts are offered at the beginning of a feed when her suck is strongest If you have sore nipples continue feeding making sure your baby is properly latched on the breast \r\n\r\nCracked nipples\r\n\r\nCause and symptoms.\r\n\r\nNipples bleeding through a small crack or sore in the skin can result from untreated sore nipples.\r\n\r\nCommon causes include poor positioning, a reaction to soaps that dry the skin, reattaching your bra while the nipples are still wet or using a damp breast pad.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nIf you are in real pain seek advice. Generally you will be advised to keep on feeding if at all possible. Try to find a more comfortable position for your baby to feed and one where your baby is properly latched on. If it is too painful you should carefully express your milk and give it to your baby. Squeeze out a drop or two of your own milk at the end of a feed and rub it into the areola and nipple. Keep nipples dry and exposed to the air as much as possible. Regularly change your breast pads so they are fresh and dry. Wear a cotton bra to allow the air to circulate. Change yoru bra regularly. If you wish you could use a small amount of purified lanolin on cracked nipples, which may assist with healing. Avoid using soap or other perfumed products on yoru nipples. \r\n\r\nBlocked ducts\r\n\r\nCause and symptoms\r\n\r\nThe swelling is caused by the collection of milk in the duct, often through missing a feed or if the breast isn’t being emptied fully. \r\n\r\nThe blockage of the duct can lead to mastitis (see below) as the milk gets forced out of the duct and into the surrounding tissue, causing swelling and a hot and painful breast.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nDo not stop feeding as this will make it much worse. Feed as often as you can. If feeding hurts too much, use a breast pump to express your milk. Try different feeding positions and make sure your baby is latched on properly. Warmth on your breast before a feed can help the milk to flow and make you feel more comfortable. Try warm flannels or a bath or shower. Placing a cold flannel on the breast after a feed can help to relieve any discomfort. Offer the affected breast first as your baby’s strongest sucking at the beginning of the feed will help to get the milk moving through the ducts again. If it is too painful, gently express until you feel able to feed your baby. \r\n\r\nMastitis\r\n\r\nCause and symptoms\r\n\r\nMastitis is a condition that causes the breast tissue to become painful and inflamed. It usually only affects one breast which can become red and swollen and can also cause flu-like symptoms such as a fever, chills, aches and tiredness. \r\n\r\nThere are two types of mastitis: infectious (usually caused by bacteria) and non-infectious (usually caused by a blocked milk duct or problems with breastfeeding).\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nIf you think you have mastitis seek advice from your midwife or GP. It is important to try to continue to feed from the affected breast as it can help release blocked milk in the breast as well as easing the symptoms more quickly and preventing them becoming more serious. Make sure your baby is latching on correctly and that the breast is empty after every feed. If it isn’t, express any remaining milk. Expressing between feeds can also help alleviate the symptoms. Rest and drink plenty of fluids. Avoid tight-fitting clothing and wired bras. Use painkillers such as paracetamol or ibuprofen to reduce pain and fever. A small amount of paracetamol or ibuprofen can enter the breast milk but is not enough to harm the baby. Place a cloth warmed by hot water over the breast to relieve symptoms. This can soften the breast too, making it easier for your baby to feed. Massage your breast to release any blockages. Stroke from the lumpy area towards the nipple to help the milk flow. Do this in the bath or shower as the warmth can soften the skin If there is no improvement within 12 to 24 hours or you start to feel worse contact your healthcare professional. They may prescribe antibiotics that are safe to use during breastfeeding \r\n\r\nBreast abscesses\r\n\r\nCause\r\n\r\nAn abscess can occur following mastitis. A breast abscess feels like a painful, swollen lump in the breast and can also be red, feel hot and can cause a fever.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nSeek medical help help straight away if you experience the symptoms \r\n\r\nAn abscess can be treated with antibiotics\r\n\r\nIf more serious, it can be drained with a needle and syringe or by making an incision to let the pus escape.\r\n\r\nThrush\r\n\r\nSymptoms\r\n\r\nIf you suddenly get sore, cracked nipples after you’ve been feeding without problems for a while, you may have an infection known as thrush. \r\n\r\nYour baby has thrush if you can see patches of yellow or cream-coloured, like cottage cheese in her mouth which doesn't go away between feeds.\r\n\r\nIt is very easy to give thrush to each other so if your baby has it in their mouth it can easily spread to your nipples and vica versa. Thrush can give rise to sore itchy nipples and will require treatment with cream and sometimes oral anti-fungal tablets. Seek advice from your GP or health visitor.\r\n\r\nIf your GP decides that your baby needs treatment, they will probably prescribe an anti-fungal medicine which can be given as a gel to apply, or an oral suspension which kills the fungus in your baby's mouth.\r\n\r\nOral thrush may not bother your baby but if her mouth is sore she may be reluctant to feed. Babies rarely have oral thrush in their first week of life. It is most common in babies around four weeks old. Older babies can get it too, but this is less common.\r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nMake an appointment with your GP straight away and, if it is a yeast infection, both you and your baby will need treatment.\r\n\r\nSore, itchy nipples will require treatment with cream and sometimes oral anti-fungal tablets.\r\n\r\nIf your baby needs treatment, an anti-fungal medicine will be prescribed which can be given as a gel to apply, or an oral suspension.\r\n\r\nTongue-tie babies\r\n\r\nCause and symptoms\r\n\r\nSome babies are born with a tongue-tie which is when there is a tight piece of skin between the underside of their tongue and the floor of their mouth. \r\n\r\nThis can affect feeding by making it hard for your baby to attach effectively to the breast. It can also cause nipple soreness as your baby is unable to latch on properly. \r\n\r\nTreatment\r\n\r\nThe good news is that doctors can easily fix the condition with a minor surgical procedure and your baby can then feed properly. If you think your baby might be tongue-tied, contact your midwife, GP or a lactation consultant immediately.\r\n\r\nBreastfeeding after a Caesarean\r\n\r\nIt is fine to breastfeed after a Caesarean and getting into a comfortable position while you are doing it is the key to successful feeding. \r\n\r\nTuck your baby’s body under your arm and support her head with your hand, using a couple of cushions for support to avoid her pressing down on your tummy. \r\n\r\nIf sitting up is too painful or difficult, feed her by lying on your side with your baby facing you. \r\n\r\nA midwife will be on hand to help you get into the right position. Any drugs you are having for pain relief will only pass to your baby in tiny proportions and the most important thing is you are without pain and able to feed your baby as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nLow milk supply\r\n\r\nPoor positioning so that the baby is not latched on properly or infrequent feeding is more often to blame for an inability to produce enough milk. The signs your baby is not getting enough milk are:\r\n\r\nNot being able to hear your baby swallow while feeding Poor weight gain Your baby pulling off the breast in frustration Fewer than six wet nappies a day and\/or irregular bowel movements \r\n\r\nGenerally, the more you feed your baby, the more milk your body produces so if you feel you are not making enough, aim for 8 to 12 feeds in a day and possibly use a breast pump between feeds for further stimulation if this is advised. It's also important to drink plenty of water when breastfeeding.\r\n\r\nWith these measures it is very likely that your milk supply will improve. Always consult your midwife, GP or a lactation consultant if you are concerned about your milk supply. \r\n\r\nNipple confusion\r\n\r\nIf your breast fed baby is given a dummy or bottle of expressed milk before six weeks of age there is a chance that he may become confused. The methods require completely different tongue and mouth movements and swallowing skills.\r\n\r\nDuring breastfeeding your baby uses his jaw and lips to pump the milk from the breast and he can regulate the amount\r\n\r\nArtificial teats are firm and do not fill the baby’s mouth. Babies often find that drinking from them is easier and that the milk flows more rapidly.\r\n\r\nNipple confusion can be avoided by avoiding the use of bottles and dummies until breastfeeding has been established."

       "title":"Sterilizing",
       "tipDescription":"Breastfeeding mums know that one of the many advantages is the convenience of having baby’s food in natural, easily-accessible containers that don’t need sterilising before feeds! But, if you are also expressing, you will need to make sure your feeding equipment is sterilised.\r\n\r\nMums-to-be may be a little daunted by the prospect of making sure that all of their baby’s feeding equipment would pass the most stringent of hygiene tests. But there’s no need to worry, there are several, very easy ways to ensure that everything is as clean as the proverbial whistle! \r\n\r\nDuring a baby’s first year she is more vulnerable to viruses and gut infections which can lead to anything from a mild attack of thrush to the more serious condition of gastroenteritis which can cause vomiting, diarrhoea and subsequent dehydration. \r\n\r\nIt is neither possible, nor practical, to create a totally germ-free environment for your baby but you can drastically reduce the risks by initiating a good hygiene routine. By the time your baby is one year old and fully weaned she will be producing her own antibodies and be more resistant to harmful germs. \r\n\r\nHOW TO STERILISE \r\n\r\nWash first\r\n\r\nWashing feeding equipment in hot soapy water does not sterilise it, however it is a good idea to do this before your sterilising routine. Wash everything as soon after use as you can so that every trace of milk is removed. Use a brush and make sure that the detergent you've used has been carefully rinsed off. \r\n\r\nCheck the feeding equipment carefully and throw out any with splits or cracks because damaged surfaces can also harbour bacteria. \r\n\r\nProviding your baby's feeding equipment is dishwasher safe you can use the dishwasher to clean the items before sterilising them. Always check though, as some items are best washed by hand before being sterilised.\r\n\r\nIt should go without saying that when handling your baby’s feeding equipment (especially after sterilisation) your own hands should be washed clean with soap and hot water.\r\n\r\nElectric steam and microwave sterilising\r\n\r\nMicrowave and electric sterilising units are popular and easy to use. However, you may not always have access to electricity or a microwave, so it is worth being familiar with more traditional methods of sterilising as well.\r\n\r\nElectric steam sterilising equipment takes from 8 to 12 minutes, plus cooling time. You must be careful that you only put in equipment that is safe to boil (check the markings) as the temperatures reached are extremely high.\r\n\r\nSteam sterilisers, which are based on the method used by hospitals, have the advantage that there is no smell or taste involved and the items remain sterile for three to six hours, depending on the model, if the lid is kept on.\r\n\r\nSterilisers, that are specifically made for microwaves are efficient and easy to use, but always be careful that nothing metal is placed inside them. They take around five to eight minutes to work, plus cooling time. They are useful for travel and taking on holiday providing there is a microwave available.\r\n\r\nAlways check that the power on your microwave is sufficient for the equipment and follow the manufacturer’s advice to the letter.\r\n\r\nBoiling\r\n\r\nThe oldest method of sterilising is boiling and this is perfectly adequate, although not as convenient as the new methods. Most feeding equipment needs to be boiled for at least 10 minutes. \r\n\r\nThe pan you use must be used exclusively for that purpose and should have a lid. The items need to be kept under the surface of the water during the boiling time.\r\n\r\nIdeally they should be used as soon as sterilisation is complete. Unused items should be reassembled so that they do not become contaminated. \r\n\r\nSome items will have to be replaced more often if you use this method, as they get sticky. Always be careful when boiling water as it is easy to get scalded.\r\n\r\nMicrowavable feeding equipment\r\n\r\nYou can buy special feeding equipment that can be sterilised in the microwave in just 3 minutes. After taking apart they should be washed thoroughly in warm soapy water, then rinsed before being placed in the microwave. It's important to follow the manufacturers instructions when microwaving; to make sure that pressure doesn't build up inside during the heating process. \r\n\r\nCold water sterilising \r\n\r\nThis uses a non-toxic solution in liquid or tablet form. The solution is highly effective against bacteria. It is safe to use and can be applied to the skin or even swallowed with no harmful effects.\r\n\r\nYou can buy special sterilising units for this purpose, but you could use a new bucket or plastic container with a lid, provided there is something to stop the equipment bobbing to the surface (a plate will do). It's important to make sure that there is no air trapped inside the containers.\r\n\r\nThe equipment should be sterile after half an hour and can safely be left in the solution for up to 24 hours. You will need to change the solution daily and remember to wash your hands before removing the sterilised items. You may wish to rinse off the fluid with cool, boiled water, but this is not actually necessary.\r\n\r\nStore Safely\r\n\r\nAvoid leaving sterilised empty containers out on work surfaces as they will quickly lose their sterility and keep them well away from greasy areas (cookers, work tops). \r\n\r\nStorage is not usually a problem when sterilisers have built-in storage facilities so that items can be removed when required."

       "title":"Breastfeeding in public",
       "tipDescription":"When your baby is hungry the most natural thing in the world for you to do is to feed her, whether you are alone, with family and friends or you’re out and about. You may feel a bit shy about breastfeeding in public at first, but once you have developed your own technique for feeding in front of others, you won’t give it a second thought.\r\n\r\nYou may think that people will stare or making comments if you breastfeed in public, but the truth is that the majority of people don’t have a problem with women breastfeeding in public places at all. In fact, many people don’t even notice a woman breastfeeding, whereas they do notice a hungry baby crying.\r\n\r\nTips for breastfeeding in public\r\n\r\n1. Plan ahead\r\n\r\nIf you’re new to this, you may feel more comfortable going to a café or coffee shop where you know other mums will be breastfeeding, or to a store that has a special mother and baby area. Ask friends with babies for recommendations and consider taking your own mum or a friend with you for support.\r\n\r\n2. What to wear \r\n\r\nThe right clothing is the key to discreet breastfeeding. Dresses, or tops with buttons down the front are best avoided as they are likely to expose more of you than you would like! Look for breastfeeding tops with a discreet opening, which allows easy access. Alternatively, you can just wear your normal tops with a vest underneath so that you can pull your top up and vest down to create an opening. \r\n\r\nA maternity bra or a soft, non-wired bra, which can simply be pulled up or down will make things easier. \r\n\r\n3. Extra privacy \r\n\r\nA scarf or muslin draped over your chest while your baby feeds will give you privacy and help to stop your baby from being distracted. Some baby slings are also designed to be used for breastfeeding.\r\n\r\n4. Breast pads\r\n\r\nKeep some spare breast pads in your nappy bag and carry a bottle of water with you, as breastfeeding is thirsty work\r\n\r\n5. Avoid public toilets \r\n\r\nYou wouldn’t eat in a public toilet so you shouldn’t ever feel that you need to feed your baby in one, either. \r\n\r\nYou have a right to breastfeed in public\r\n\r\nThe law is on your side ­ – in England and Wales your right to breastfeed in public is covered by The Equality Act 2010, which says that a business cannot discriminate against mothers who are breastfeeding a child of any age. This means that you can’t be asked to leave premises or be refused service in places such as cafes and shops. You are also quite within your rights to breastfeed in public open spaces such as parks, on public transport and in places like theatres and cinemas. \r\n\r\nIn Northern Ireland, the Health Promotion Agency has been encouraging the general public to be supportive of mothers breastfeeding in public places since 2004. Breastfeeding mothers also have protection under the Sex Discrimination Act.\r\n\r\nThe law in Scotland goes further, making it is a criminal offence to try and stop a woman breastfeeding a child under 24 months in a public place.\r\n\r\nTo find out more about your rights go to www.maternityaction.org.uk.\r\n\r\nWhat our mums say about breastfeeding in public:\r\n\r\n“Just because a woman is a mother she doesn't lose her right to eat out. Babies need feeding too, so why not? I think it's far less intrusive to have a mum breastfeeding where you can choose not to look than to have a hungry baby screaming where you have no choice but to listen.”\r\n\r\n“A baby needs food too. Not allowing this would effectively ban breastfeeding women from restaurants.”\r\n\r\nFind out the results from our breastfeeding in public survey here"

       "title":"Your breastfeeding diet",
       "tipDescription":"While small amounts of what you eat and drink can find their way into breast milk, there is no special diet you need to follow while breastfeeding. \r\n\r\nTry to eat a healthy, balanced diet that includes at least five portions of fresh fruit and vegetables, starchy foods like wholemeal bread and rice, as well as protein and dairy foods. \r\n\r\nYou may feel hungrier while feeding, so plan healthy snacks, such as carrots and hummus, wholemeal toast, dried fruit and yoghurts, to keep you going between meals.\r\n\r\nHere we answer your top breastfeeding diet FAQs:\r\n\r\nQ. Can I eat fish when breastfeeding?\r\n\r\nOily fish, such as sardines, mackerel, salmon and trout, contain healthy fats, so it's good to have a couple of portions a week, but no more than this as these fish can contain pollutants. There is no restriction on how much canned tuna and non-oily fish such as cod, haddock and plaice you can eat.\r\n\r\nQ. Do I need to take vitamin D supplements when breastfeeding\r\n\r\nWhile most vitamins are obtained through a healthy diet, vitamin D, obtained from exposure to sunlight, is often lacking. It's therefore recommended that all breastfeeding mothers take a daily 10mcg vitamin D supplement, which will be passed on to your baby through your milk.\r\n\r\nIf you didn't take a vitamin D supplement during pregnancy, your baby may also need vitamin D drops when she is one month old. Ask your midwife for advice.\r\n\r\nQ. What should I drink when breastfeeding?\r\n\r\nDrink plenty of water while breastfeeding. Try to limit your intake of caffeine-containing drinks such as tea, as the caffeine may affect your baby's sleep. \r\n\r\nQ. Can I drink alcohol when breastfeeding?\r\n\r\nWhile there is no official recommendation for alcohol consumption while breastfeeding, the general advice is either to avoid alcohol, or try to limit yourself to one or two units once or twice a week. Bear in mind that it takes a couple of hours for alcohol to leave the bloodstream, so it makes sense to feed your baby just before a meal and a unit of drink so your body has time to process the alcohol before the next feed."

       "title":"Baby fun and games",
       "tipDescription":"Play isn't just about you and your baby having fun together, it is also a great way for your her to learn a lot of the basic skills she'll need as she gets older. \r\n\r\nHere we explain how you can help your baby's development through play.\r\n\r\nThe basic skills\r\n\r\nPlay during the first few months is more about sensory exploration than physical activity. By introducing your baby to objects that she can see, hear and touch you will be helping her to become familiar with her world.\r\n\r\nAt this stage your baby doesn't really need toys as you're her best plaything. She'll have the most fun from being sung to and rocked and watching you pulling funny faces.\r\n\r\nLater, as your baby gains control of her muscles, you will be able to introduce play that will help to develop her hand-eye co-ordination, encourage manipulative skills and teach her about cause and effect. \r\n\r\nAs her play becomes more creative she will start to use her imagination and begin to work things out for herself.\r\n\r\nSight\r\n\r\nFrom the moment she's born your baby is capable of distinguishing between human faces and other objects. \r\n\r\nAt first your baby will be perfectly content just to watch your face and listen to your voice. It's not a coincidence that a newborn sees best when the object she's looking at is around 20-35cm (8-10ins) away – that's the distance your face is from her when she is feeding.\r\n\r\nAfter a week or so, you'll find that she starts to notice bright primary colours and is attracted to the sharp contrast of black and white patterns. \r\n\r\nShe'll also enjoy watching slow moving objects if they are at the right distance. Try hanging a mobile where she can see it. A mirror attached to the side of the cot where she can watch herself will give hours of entertainment, too.\r\n\r\nAs her visual perception develops your baby will start to track objects with her eyes. Try shaking an object to attract her attention, then move it slowly from side to side so that her eyes can follow the movement. \r\n\r\nAt first she may only do this for a second or two, but as she gets older she'll be able to do this for longer and will start to track items moving in different directions.\r\n\r\nSounds \r\n\r\nYour baby's hearing is quite well developed at birth so during the first few months she will spend her time learning how to locate the source of the noises she can hear. You can help by playing sound tracking games, simply shake a rattle or bell to get your baby's attention and then move it from one side to the other to see if she makes any movement towards the noise. \r\n\r\nShe won't master this skill overnight, but once she has you'll be able to use it as a basis for other games. It's important for your baby to experience lots of different sounds so play music, talk and sing to her.\r\n\r\nTouch\r\n\r\nYour baby will use touch just as much as her other senses to discover her world. Even at birth she will show a preference for softness against her skin. \r\n\r\nShe'll especially enjoy feeling your skin so let her explore your face and hands and touch your breast as she feeds. As she gets older she'll find toys with different textures fascinating. \r\n\r\nWhen she becomes stronger and her movements are more controlled she will start to reach out for things to hold. This is how she finds out about the difference between things being light and heavy, hard and soft.\r\n\r\nToys\r\n\r\nAlthough your baby will probably show great interest in the toys you play with together, at this stage it's because she's enjoying the play rather than the toys themselves. \r\n\r\nDo make sure that any toys you give your baby are appropriate for her age – toys for older children may contain parts that could be dangerous, while toys that are too young will become boring.\r\n\r\nPlaying together \r\n\r\nEven at a very young age your baby will enjoy games such as 'peek-a-boo', 'round and round the garden' and 'incy wincy spider'. \r\n\r\nOnce she's gained control of her head she'll enjoy games which involve more rough and tumble, such as being held so that she is flying through the air and jumping up and down while you hold her.\r\n\r\nBe guided by your baby – some days she may want to play games which include a lot of interaction, on others she may be happier sitting having a cuddle while you look at a book together.\r\n\r\nPlay safe\r\n\r\nCheck that the area is safe before putting your baby down to play. Only give her toys that are marked BS EN71 and bear the CE or Lion mark. Make sure your baby's toys are suitable for her age. Check the toys regularly for sharp or broken bits that could hurt your baby. Never leave your baby alone with a soft toy that has a hanging loop attached. It could easily get wrapped around her finger, hand or even her neck, if the loop is large enough."

       "title":"Storytime",
       "tipDescription":"It’s never too early to introduce your child to the world of books and stories. \r\n\r\nMany studies show that reading to children regularly is one of the best ways to expose them to language, which in turn gives them a social and educational head start. In fact, the more you read to your child, the greater her future reading and cognitive skills will be.\r\n\r\nSo how does reading help your child?\r\n\r\nMaking books and stories part of your child’s everyday routine has significant advantages.\r\n\r\nReading to your child each day helps her grow accustomed to the patterns of speech and language as she listens repeatedly to sounds and words. She also expands her vocabulary and, over time, her understanding of words, further enriching the pleasure she gets from listening to stories. Spending time sitting together and sharing stories nurtures your relationship. Your on-the-go toddler or pre-schooler rarely has time to sit still. Building in a quiet reading time gives you both a chance to slow down and enjoy being together. Bedtime stories can become a cherished time, when you both wind down at the end of the day and snuggle up to enjoy a favourite book. Your child feels safe and loved, which in turn teaches her to connect books with pleasurable feelings. Making books part of your child’s everyday experience helps her to discover that reading is fun. Moreover, sharing books early on is the first step to your child becoming an independent reader and nurtures a life-long love of reading. Handling books and turning pages helps your toddler and young child to hone her fine motor skills. Looking at first books together helps her start to understand that it’s not you making up stories, but the written marks on a page that form letters and words. Over time, she will start to recognise the different letters of the alphabet. Her brain will be busy making these new connections, which she will continue to use for language and thinking. Your child discovers the world of stories and make-believe. As she gets older, books will fire her imagination and encourage her to create her own unique stories and mini worlds. Over time, your child can discover other types of books, such as information books that enable her to explore favourite topics. Sharing books is a great way to explore emotions. Books about particular events such as moving house, welcoming a new sibling or going to a new school can help your child understand these changes and find ways to deal with them. \r\n\r\nEngaging your child\r\n\r\nThe way your child interacts with stories and the books she enjoys will change and evolve over time. Choose age-appropriate books that are tailored to her developmental stage to maximize her enjoyment. Make storytelling fun and engaging:\r\n\r\nRead with animation and expression to bring the story alive and make it a pleasure to listen to. Read slowly too, so your child can catch the words and meaning. Choose stories with rhymes, songs and repetition. Your child will love the simplicity and rhythm of these, and they help her develop an understanding of sounds and how words begin and end. Choose durable board books for younger toddlers that will withstand being chewed and bashed. Choose short books with plenty of engaging pictures. Look for subjects young children enjoy such as animals, children, families and transport. As your child gets older, you can start to introduce slightly more complex stories with events and narratives they can relate to, such as making new friends at nursery, and with adventure-based tales. Visit the local library, the perfect place for building children’s literacy. Make this a fun trip and get your child involved, asking her how many books she wants to borrow and seeing if she wants to choose one or two herself. Check the notice board for story times and activities for young children. Be prepared to read the same story again and again. Toddlers and young children love repetition and will often want the same book read for weeks at a time. This may drive you a bit crazy, but one study showed that repeated exposure to the same book helped cement vocabulary. Feel free to veer from the story. Talk about the pictures and point to and name different characters and objects. Ask your older child what they think happens next and welcome questions from her. Make it lots of fun. Use actions, funny voices, finger puppets and anything else to entertain your child. \r\n\r\nReading together will become a looked-forward to part of your child’s day and engender a life-long interest in books, one of the most valuable things you can give her.\r\n\r\nKeep reading fun, natural and never hard work. Let her choose books and make them part of her everyday environment, with books in baskets and on low shelves for whenever she wants a browse."

       "tipDescription":"Babies love to play games and seem to have an inexhaustible supply of patience for playing the same thing over and over again. So harness their enthusiasm and get playing.Here are our favourite baby games to play \r\n\r\n1. Peek-a-boo\r\n\r\nThis one always has little ones chuckling. Hide behind something – a book, a muslin, a door, even a cardboard box. Wait a few seconds and then suddenly peep out at your baby, give a big smile and say “peek-a-boo!” \r\n\r\nSoon your baby will be waiting for you to go back into your hiding place and laughing even before you pop out again! \r\n\r\n2. Heads, shoulders, knees and toes\r\n\r\n“Heads, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes\r\nHeads, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes\r\nAnd eyes and ears and mouth and nose\r\nHeads, shoulders, knees and toes, knees and toes”\r\n\r\nEven if your singing voice isn't the best, this neat little song is great for teaching your baby about the parts of the body. Start with your baby lying on your lap, in a bouncing chair or on the bed with you, gently touch their head as you start to sing, then move each hand to the next parts as you continue the rhyme. \r\n\r\n3. “Round and round the garden…”\r\n\r\nTaking your child’s hand or foot, begin to trace a circle on the palm of the hand or sole of the foot and then say:\r\n\r\n“Round and round the garden\r\nGoes the teddy bear\r\nOne step\r\nTwo step\r\nTickle you under there!”\r\n\r\nFrom the hand or foot, you walk your fingers up their arm or leg and tickle your baby under the armpit. Guaranteed giggles all round!\r\n\r\n4. Bash it down\r\n\r\nThis one works best with babies who can sit on their own for a short time… Simply take some blocks, building bricks, pots or cups and stack them one on top of the other. \r\n\r\nCount as you go - five is probably plenty. And then you say: “And…bash it all down!” and knock the pile over as you do so. \r\n\r\nEncourage your baby as he grows to help you pile up the items and count with you.\r\n\r\n5. Incey wincy spider\r\n\r\nThis is a rhyme you say whilst making movements with your hands to amuse your baby. \r\n\r\n“Incy Wincy spider\r\nClimbed the water spout\r\nDown came the rain\r\nAnd washed poor spider out\r\nOut came the sunshine\r\nAnd dried up all the rain\r\nAnd incy wincy spider\r\nClimbed the spout again.”\r\n\r\n6. Old MacDonald\r\n\r\nThere’s nothing as much fun as a song that has animal noises in which will cause both you and your baby to chortle. \r\n\r\n“Old MacDonald had a farm\r\nEe-eye-ee-eye-oh\r\nAnd on that farm he had a dog\r\nEe-eye-ee-eye-oh\r\nWith a woof-woof here \r\nand a woof-woof there\r\nhere a woof\r\nthere a woof\r\neverywhere a woof-woof\r\nOld MacDonald had a farm\r\nEe-eye-ee-eye-oh.”\r\n\r\n7. This little piggy\r\n\r\nAnother favourite classic baby game; there can’t be many adults whose toes weren’t pulled in this game!\r\n\r\n“This little piggy went to market\r\nThis little piggy stayed at home\r\nThis little piggy had roast beef\r\nThis little piggy had none\r\nAnd This little piggy went – wee, wee, wee, all the way home.”\r\n\r\nThis is played with your little one's bare toes and is great before you bath your baby. \r\n\r\n8. Rolling a ball\r\n\r\nA very simple game is rolling a ball to your baby and encouraging him to roll it back to you. Sit your baby on the floor, perhaps supported by a cushion, then roll a large, soft ball towards them. At first they won’t be able to do much with it but eventually, he will stop it with a hand and send it back to you."
